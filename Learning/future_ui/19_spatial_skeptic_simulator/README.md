# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Reality Check Layer: Testing the Vision

### Project 19: Spatial Skeptic Simulator

**What You're Building**: A/B testing framework for spatial vs 2D

- Measure task completion time in both modes
- Track user frustration and error rates
- Identify when spatial helps vs hinders
- Generate "spatial appropriateness" scores
- **Why It Matters**: Avoid gimmicky 3D that hurts productivity
