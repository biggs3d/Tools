# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Governance & Control Layer: Human Authority

### Project 8: AI Governance & Policy Engine

**What You're Building**: Enforces business rules before AI acts

- Rule-based constraints ("Finance AI can't show salaries")
- Audit log of all policy checks
- "Safe mode" for sensitive contexts
- Regulatory compliance templates (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR)
- **Why It Matters**: Trust and compliance are non-negotiable for enterprises
