# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Intelligence Layer: The Memory Core

### Project 10: Contextual Memory Bank

**What You're Building**: Persistent memory for every user interaction

- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Auto-forgets irrelevant information
- Privacy-first design with user data control
- Cross-session, cross-device memory sync
- **Why It Matters**: AI assistants need to remember YOU
