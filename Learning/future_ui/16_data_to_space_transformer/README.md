# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Spatial Layer: The New Dimension

### Project 16: Data-to-Space Transformer

**What You're Building**: Convert any dataset into navigable 3D space

- Automatic spatial layout algorithms
- Gesture control library
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Accessibility layer for 2D fallback
- **Why It Matters**: Future UIs are spatial, not flat
