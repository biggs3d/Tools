## Foundation Layer: The Integration Engine

### Project 3: Real-Time Event Mesh

**What You're Building**: Distributed event streaming that "just works"

- WebSocket manager with auto-reconnect
- Event routing based on content, not just topics
- Automatic backpressure handling
- Time-travel debugging for event streams
- **Why It Matters**: Spatial UIs need instant updates from everywhere
