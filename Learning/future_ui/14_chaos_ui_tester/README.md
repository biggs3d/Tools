# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Reliability Layer: The Trust Foundation

### Project 14: Chaos UI Tester

**What You're Building**: Testing framework for non-deterministic UIs

- Fuzzes AI-generated interfaces
- Property-based testing for components
- Visual regression with AI similarity scoring
- User journey replay with variations
- **Why It Matters**: How do you test something that's different every time?
