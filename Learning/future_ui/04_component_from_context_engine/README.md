# Future UI Building Blocks: Practical Projects Toward Intelligent Interfaces

## Dynamic Generation Layer: The UI Factory

### Project 4: Component-from-Context Engine

**What You're Building**: System that creates UI components from data shape alone

- Analyzes JSON/data structure â†’ generates optimal UI
- No configuration needed - it figures it out
- Handles charts, forms, lists, trees automatically
- Exports to React/Vue/Vanilla JS
- **Why It Matters**: Stop building dashboards, let data build itself
