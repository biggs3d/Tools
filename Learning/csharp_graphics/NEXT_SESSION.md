# Next Session Guide

## üéØ Where We Left Off
Building placement system is fully operational with visual feedback! Players can now place all 5 building types with smart terrain validation and see their actual PNG graphics.

## ‚úÖ Last Session Accomplishments (2025-08-24)
- **Building Placement System Complete!**
  - Created 5 building PNG textures (64x64): water_gatherer, ore_extractor, rock_harvester, factory_purple_diamond, residential
  - Built BuildingTextures helper class for texture management
  - Implemented BuildingPlacementMode with smart validation
  - Added color-coded placement preview (green=valid, yellow=warning, red=invalid)
  - Integrated building textures into GridRenderer
  
- **UI Improvements**
  - Hotkeys 1-5 for building selection
  - Visual placement validation with terrain checking  
  - Warning indicators for suboptimal placement
  - Status text shows selected building
  - Q key to cancel placement mode
  
- **Documentation**
  - Created NEEDED.md with comprehensive texture list
  - Advised on test project structure (keep separate)
  - Updated all progress tracking

## üöÄ Ready to Start: Phase 3 - Production Chains

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
cd /Users/sbiggs/Development/D-Drive/Tools/Learning/csharp_graphics/CityBuilder
dotnet build  # Main project builds successfully
dotnet run    # Test the game
```

### Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. Implement Factory Production Logic (2-3 hours)
The FactoryTier2Definition exists but needs actual production:
- Consume Blue Teardrops + Red Squares ‚Üí Produce Purple Diamonds
- Check HasRequiredInputs() before production
- Implement production tick in BuildingManager
- Update inventory consumption/production rates

#### 2. Create Additional Factory Types (1-2 hours)
Need separate factory definitions for:
- `FactoryGreenHexagon` - Blue + Yellow ‚Üí Green
- `FactoryOrangeCircle` - Yellow + Red ‚Üí Orange
- Later: Tier 3 factories for advanced resources

#### 3. Visual Feedback for Production (2-3 hours)
- Display shape textures on vehicles (already have ResourceTextures)
- Show floating resource icons when buildings produce
- Add inventory bars showing resource levels
- Production state indicators (active/idle/blocked)

### Key Files to Modify
1. `src/Simulation/BuildingManager.cs` - Add production tick logic
2. `src/Simulation/Buildings/` - Create new factory definitions
3. `src/Rendering/GridRenderer.cs` - Add resource flow visuals
4. `src/States/PlayState.cs` - Display production indicators
5. `src/Simulation/Vehicle.cs` - Show cargo shape textures

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Buildings place with visual feedback ‚úÖ
- [x] Terrain validation works for gatherers ‚úÖ
- [x] Building textures display correctly ‚úÖ
- [ ] Factories consume input resources
- [ ] Factories produce output resources
- [ ] Vehicles show shape textures as cargo
- [ ] Resource flow animations work
- [ ] Production stops when inputs unavailable

## üéÆ Game Controls Reference
- **WASD/Arrows** - Move camera (hold SHIFT for 3x speed)
- **Mouse scroll** - Zoom in/out
- **Left click** - Place selected item
- **Right click** - Remove tile / Cancel placement
- **1-5 keys** - Select buildings:
  - 1: Water Gatherer (round, gathers blue teardrops)
  - 2: Ore Extractor (square, mines red squares)
  - 3: Rock Harvester (triangle, harvests yellow triangles)
  - 4: Factory Tier 2 (produces purple diamonds)
  - 5: Residential (consumes resources)
- **Q** - Cancel building placement mode
- **V** - Spawn test vehicle
- **G** - Generate small city
- **C** - Toggle supply chain mode
- **P/Space** - Pause
- **F1** - Toggle grid
- **F2** - Toggle chunk boundaries
- **ESC** - Return to menu

## üìù Design Reminders
- **Integer resources only** - No decimals!
- **Shape/color identity is core** - Everything supports this
- **Keep it simple** - No processing buildings
- **Lvl2 buildings = 2 grid spaces** - Visual progression
- **Building level affects production speed** - Config-driven balancing

## üêõ Known Issues
- Tests are broken (reference old TileType values) - **4 errors**
  - TileType.Commercial and TileType.Industrial no longer exist
  - Tests need updating to use new building types
- Factory production not yet implemented (buildings exist but don't produce)
- Vehicles don't display cargo shape textures yet
- No floating resource icons on production
- No inventory bar visualization

## üí° Configuration Ideas
Add to GameConstants.cs:
```csharp
// Production rates by building level (resources per minute)
public static readonly int[] GatheringRatesByLevel = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };

// Terrain check radius (how far to look for terrain)
public const int TerrainCheckRadius = 1; // Adjacent tiles only
```

## üéØ Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Factories consume input resources properly
- [ ] Factories produce output resources at correct rates
- [ ] Supply chain works: Gatherer ‚Üí Factory ‚Üí Consumer
- [ ] Visual feedback shows resource flow
- [ ] Production states clearly indicated (active/idle/blocked)
- [ ] Can build complete chain: Water + Ore ‚Üí Purple Diamond ‚Üí Residential
