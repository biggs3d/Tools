# Next Session Guide

## Current Status âœ…
**Phase 5 COMPLETE**: Supply chain system integrated! Buildings produce/consume resources, vehicles deliver based on inventory needs!

## What Was Just Completed (Session 8 - 2025-08-22)
1. **Supply Chain Integration**
   - Created BuildingManager to track all buildings
   - Buildings maintain inventory with production/consumption rates
   - Industrial produces raw materials, Commercial converts to goods, Residential consumes
   - Waste accumulates and needs export to hub
   - Task generation based on inventory thresholds with hysteresis

2. **Resource Delivery System**
   - ResourceDeliveryTask extends DeliveryTask with resource info
   - PickupRequest/DeliveryOffer matching system
   - Import from hub when local supply unavailable
   - Export to hub for excess resources (especially waste)
   - Visual cargo colors matching resource types

3. **Visual Design Improvements**
   - Building colors match their production (brown=Industrial, blue=Commercial, green=Residential)
   - Vehicle cargo shown with matching colors during delivery
   - Building icons added (I=Industrial, $=Commercial, H=House)
   - Consistent color scheme across buildings and cargo

4. **New Controls**
   - C key: Toggle between supply chain mode and simple random tasks
   - Supply chain enabled by default

## What Was Previously Completed (Session 7 - 2025-08-18)
1. **Procedural City Generator**
   - Created deterministic city generation with seeded Random
   - Branching road network algorithm from hub
   - Building placement along roads with density control
   - Three generation modes:
     - G key: Small city (radius 10, 8 branches)
     - Shift+G: Large city (radius 40, 50 branches)
     - Ctrl+G: Clear city (keeps hub)
   - Parameters: seed, radius, branch probability, turn probability, building density
   - Respects terrain constraints (no building on water/mountains)

2. **Delivery Task Visualization**
   - Pickup markers (blue diamonds with "P") appear during pickup phase
   - Delivery markers (green diamonds with "D") appear during delivery phase
   - Path lines drawn from vehicle to current target
   - Markers only show for relevant vehicle states

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Average path length display when >10 vehicles
   - FPS warning when drops below 60
   - Stress test keys: T (spawn 10), Shift+T (spawn 100)
   - Real-time vehicle and task counts in HUD

4. **Enhanced Controls**
   - V key: Spawn single test vehicle
   - T key: Spawn 10 vehicles (stress test)
   - Shift+T: Spawn 100 vehicles (super stress test)
   - Updated help text with new controls

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 5: Polish & UX
```bash
cd /mnt/d/Tools/Learning/csharp_graphics/CityBuilder
./test-game.sh   # Run the game (ESC to exit)
dotnet test      # Run all 55 unit tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Grid"  # Run just Grid tests
```

### Game Controls
- **WASD/Arrows** - Move camera (hold SHIFT for 3x speed)
- **Mouse scroll** - Zoom in/out (clamped 0.1-4.0)
- **Left click** - Place road
- **Right click** - Remove tile
- **1-3 keys** - Place buildings (residential/commercial/industrial)
- **F1** - Toggle grid overlay
- **F2** - Toggle chunk boundaries (debug)
- **P/Space** - Pause
- **ESC** - Return to menu

## Tests Fixed This Session
- âœ… Fixed ALL PathfindingServiceTests (9 tests passing)
  - Corrected hub placement for road connectivity requirements
  - Updated test coordinates to work with validation rules
  - Fixed path caching tests to expect immutable path instances

- âœ… Fixed ALL StateManagerTests (7/7 passing) 
  - Created proper test interfaces (ITestState1, ITestState2)
  - Fixed state registration with unique types
  - Simplified EventBus test to direct state change
  - Used LLM bridges to diagnose complex mock/timing issues


### What To Do Next Session

1. **Gameplay Tuning & Balance**:
   - Balance production/consumption rates for better flow
   - Adjust inventory thresholds to prevent stockpiling
   - Fine-tune vehicle capacity and speed
   - Test different city layouts for emergent behavior
   - Add UI feedback for resource shortages/surpluses

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement spatial indexing for building lookups
   - Optimize task matching algorithm
   - Add LOD system for distant buildings
   - Profile and optimize inventory updates

3. **Enhanced Visuals**:
   - Add inventory level bars on buildings
   - Show resource icons floating when produced/consumed
   - Add particle effects for deliveries
   - Implement day/night cycle with lighting

2. **Visual Polish:**
```csharp
public class PathfindingService
{
    private readonly GridSystem _gridSystem;
    private readonly Dictionary<(Vector2Int, Vector2Int), Path> _pathCache;
    
    public Path FindPath(Vector2Int start, Vector2Int goal)
    {
        var key = (start, goal);
        if (_pathCache.TryGetValue(key, out var cached))
            return cached;
            
        var path = AStar(start, goal);
        _pathCache[key] = path;
        return path;
    }
    
    public void InvalidateCache(Rectangle dirtyRegion)
    {
        // Remove cached paths that intersect dirty region
    }
}
```

2. **Create Vehicle class:**
```csharp
public class Vehicle
{
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }
    public Vector2 TargetPosition { get; set; }
    public Path CurrentPath { get; set; }
    public DeliveryTask Task { get; set; }
    public float Speed { get; set; }
    public VehicleState State { get; set; }
}
```

3. **Create SimulationManager:**
```csharp
public class SimulationManager
{
    private const float FIXED_TIMESTEP = 1f / 30f; // 30Hz
    private float _accumulator = 0f;
    
    public void Update(float deltaTime)
    {
        _accumulator += deltaTime;
        while (_accumulator >= FIXED_TIMESTEP)
        {
            FixedUpdate(FIXED_TIMESTEP);
            _accumulator -= FIXED_TIMESTEP;
        }
    }
}
```
