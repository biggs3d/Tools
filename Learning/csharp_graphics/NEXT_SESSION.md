# Next Session Guide

## üéØ Where We Left Off
Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the shape-based resource system! The game now uses colored shapes (teardrops, squares, triangles, etc.) instead of generic resources.

## ‚úÖ Last Session Accomplishments (2025-08-22)
- **Converted entire resource system to shape-based**:
  - BlueTeardrop, RedSquare, YellowTriangle (basic resources)
  - GreenHexagon, OrangeCircle, PurpleDiamond (factory-created)
  - BlackBeam, WhitePillar, SilverTruss (advanced)
- **Integer-based inventory** - No more float resources!
- **Created placeholder textures** - 9 shape PNGs in assets/textures/shapes/
- **Built ResourceTextures helper** - Easy texture loading and color mapping
- **Updated all core systems** - BuildingData, TaskMatcher, BuildingManager
- **Consolidated documentation** - DESIGN.md is now the single source of truth

## üöÄ Ready to Start: Phase 2 - Terrain & Gathering

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
cd /Users/sbiggs/Development/D-Drive/Tools/Learning/csharp_graphics/CityBuilder
dotnet build  # Main project builds successfully (tests broken but expected)
dotnet run    # Test the game
```

### Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. Add Terrain System (2-3 hours)
Create TerrainType enum and integrate with tiles:
```csharp
public enum TerrainType {
    Normal = 0,      // Default buildable
    Water = 1,       // For blue teardrops
    OreDeposit = 2,  // For red squares  
    RockFormation = 3 // For yellow triangles
}
```

#### 2. Implement Gathering Buildings (2-3 hours)
- Round buildings check for adjacent Water tiles
- Square buildings check for OreDeposit tiles
- Triangle buildings check for RockFormation tiles
- Production only happens near correct terrain

#### 3. Visual Integration (1-2 hours)
- Display shape textures on vehicles using ResourceTextures helper
- Show floating resource icons when buildings produce
- Add inventory bars to buildings

### Key Files to Modify
1. `src/Grid/Tile.cs` - Add TerrainType property
2. `src/Grid/TerrainGenerator.cs` - Generate ore/rock patches
3. `src/Simulation/BuildingData.cs` - Check terrain for production
4. `src/Simulation/BuildingManager.cs` - Validate placement near terrain
5. `src/States/PlayState.cs` - Render resource icons

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Ore deposits and rock formations generate on map
- [ ] Round buildings only produce near water
- [ ] Square buildings only produce near ore
- [ ] Triangle buildings only produce near rock
- [ ] Vehicles display shape icon for cargo
- [ ] Resource textures load and display correctly

## üéÆ Game Controls Reference
- **WASD/Arrows** - Move camera (hold SHIFT for 3x speed)
- **Mouse scroll** - Zoom in/out
- **Left click** - Place road/building
- **Right click** - Remove tile
- **1-3 keys** - Place buildings (res/com/ind - need updating for gatherers)
- **V** - Spawn test vehicle
- **G** - Generate small city
- **C** - Toggle supply chain mode
- **P/Space** - Pause
- **F1** - Toggle grid
- **F2** - Toggle chunk boundaries
- **ESC** - Return to menu

## üìù Design Reminders
- **Integer resources only** - No decimals!
- **Shape/color identity is core** - Everything supports this
- **Keep it simple** - No processing buildings
- **Lvl2 buildings = 2 grid spaces** - Visual progression
- **Building level affects production speed** - Config-driven balancing

## üêõ Known Issues
- Tests are broken (still reference old ResourceType values) - **140 errors**
  - To fix: Replace ResourceType.RawMaterials ‚Üí BlueTeardrop/RedSquare
  - To fix: Replace ResourceType.Goods ‚Üí GreenHexagon/OrangeCircle  
  - To fix: Replace ResourceType.Waste ‚Üí YellowTriangle
  - To fix: Replace TerrainType.Grass ‚Üí TerrainType.Normal
  - To fix: Convert float values to int (remove 'f' suffix)
- Buildings still use Industrial/Commercial/Residential placeholders
- No visual feedback for resource production yet
- Need to update building placement UI for gatherers

## üí° Configuration Ideas
Add to GameConstants.cs:
```csharp
// Production rates by building level (resources per minute)
public static readonly int[] GatheringRatesByLevel = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };

// Terrain check radius (how far to look for terrain)
public const int TerrainCheckRadius = 1; // Adjacent tiles only
```

## üéØ Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Terrain types visible on map (ore = brown, rock = gray)
- [ ] Gathering buildings work with terrain
- [ ] Resources produced are correct shapes
- [ ] Visual feedback shows production
- [ ] Can build basic supply chain: Water ‚Üí Factory ‚Üí Purple Diamond
