## Session Notes

### Session 1 (2025-08-17)
- Created initial DESIGN.md document
- Decided on sparse dictionary storage for grid
- Added procedural terrain generation
- Simplified forest tiles to be aesthetic only
- Changed from moisture-based to elevation-based terrain
- Got comprehensive peer review from AI assistants
- **Major architecture improvements based on review:**
  - Switched to chunk-based storage (Dictionary<Vector2Int, TileChunk>)
  - Replaced singletons with dependency injection
  - Added EventBus for decoupled communication
  - Implemented proper Vector2Int with HashCode.Combine
  - Added AssetManager for texture/sound lifecycle
  - Introduced fixed timestep (30Hz sim, 60Hz render)
  - Removed Tile.Neighbors (calculate on-demand)
  - Added PathfindingService with caching
  - Included Camera system with chunk culling

### Next Session Focus
- Set up initial C# project with raylib-cs
- Implement EventBus and AssetManager first
- Create chunk-based grid storage system
- Test basic chunk rendering with camera
