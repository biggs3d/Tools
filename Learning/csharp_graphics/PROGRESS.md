  - [ ] Yellow + Red ‚Üí Orange Circle
  - [ ] Blue + Red ‚Üí Purple Diamond
  
- [ ] **Advanced Factories**
  - [ ] Green + Purple ‚Üí Black Beam
  - [ ] Purple + Orange ‚Üí White Pillar
  - [ ] Black + White ‚Üí Silver Trusses

### Phase 4: Contracts & Progression ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] **Orbital Contracts**
  - [ ] Timed delivery requests
  - [ ] Shape-specific requirements
  - [ ] Reward system
  - [ ] Contract difficulty scaling
  
- [ ] **Hub Expansion**

- [ ] **Research System**
  - [ ] Three branches (Efficiency, Logistics, Innovation)
  - [ ] Shape-based research costs
  - [ ] Building upgrade unlocks

### Phase 5: Polish & UX ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] **Building States**
  - [ ] Idle animations (pulsing resource outline)
  - [ ] Active state (subtle glow)
  - [ ] Blocked state (warning icon)
  - [ ] No-demand state (Zzz symbol)
  
- [ ] **Resource Flow**
  - [ ] Floating shape icons on production
  - [ ] Vehicle cargo shape display
  - [ ] Inventory bar visualization
  - [ ] Resource flow particles
  
- [ ] **Audio**
  - [ ] Shape-specific sounds
  - [ ] Production completion chimes
  - [ ] Resource shortage alerts

## Completed Core Systems ‚úÖ

### Infrastructure (Sessions 1-6)
- [x] EventBus for pub-sub messaging
- [x] AssetManager for texture/sound caching
- [x] Fixed timestep game loop (30Hz sim, 60Hz render)
- [x] State management with proper cleanup
- [x] Camera system with smooth controls
- [x] Chunk-based grid system (unlimited world)
- [x] Procedural terrain generation
- [x] A* pathfinding with caching
- [x] Vehicle system with state machine
- [x] Object pooling for performance
- [x] Supply chain task matching
- [x] Building inventory management

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] 114 unit tests (all passing)
- [x] E2E integration tests
- [x] Performance benchmarks
- [x] Test helper scripts

## Known Issues
- Tests still reference old ResourceType values (6 instead of 10)
- Building placement UI needs updating for gatherers
- No visual feedback for resource production yet

## Performance Metrics
- **Target**: 60 FPS with 100+ vehicles ‚úÖ
- **Current**: 60+ FPS maintained
- **Pathfinding**: <100ms for long paths ‚úÖ
- **Memory**: ~35MB with chunks
- **Load Time**: <1 second ‚úÖ

## Session History

### Session 9 (2025-08-22) - Shape Revolution! 
- **Transformed entire resource system to shapes!** üé®
- Analyzed GAMEPLAY.md vision vs implementation
- Converted from float to integer resources
- Created 9 shape textures in Photoshop
- Built ResourceTextures helper class
- Fixed 100+ compilation errors
- Consolidated documentation into DESIGN.md
- Prepared foundation for terrain-based gathering

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Integer resources only (no decimals)
- Removed processing buildings (keep it simple)
- Building upgrades via menu (Lvl2 = 2 spaces)
- Production time varies by building level
- Passive storage buffers initially

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/sbiggs/Development/D-Drive/Tools/Learning/csharp_graphics/CityBuilder

# Build (tests broken but main builds)
dotnet build

# Run game
dotnet run

# Test specific functionality
dotnet run -- test

# Generate city for testing
# In-game: G for small, Shift+G for large
```

## Game Controls
- **WASD/Arrows** - Move camera (SHIFT for 3x speed)
- **Mouse scroll** - Zoom
- **Left click** - Place tile
- **Right click** - Remove tile
- **1-3** - Building types (needs update for gatherers)
- **V** - Spawn vehicle
- **G** - Generate city
- **C** - Supply chain mode
- **P/Space** - Pause
- **F1** - Grid toggle
- **F2** - Chunk boundaries
- **ESC** - Menu

## Next Session Priorities
1. Add TerrainType enum to Tile struct
2. Implement terrain checking for gathering buildings
3. Update vehicle cargo display with shape textures
4. Fix broken tests with new ResourceType values
5. Create building placement UI for gatherers

## Design Principles
- **Shape/color identity is CORE** - Everything supports this
- **Integer resources** - Clean, no floating point
- **Visual intuition** - Players understand at a glance
- **Colorblind-friendly** - Shapes differentiate, not just colors
- **Keep it simple** - Complexity can be added later

> **Remember**: The shape system IS the game. Every feature must reinforce this identity!
