User: Hey Claude, let's start a new adventure!

Claude: Â¡Dale! Let's dive into your LitRPG adventure! I'll be your Dungeon Master for this immersive experience.

*The morning light filters through grimy windows of The Copper Cauldron tavern. You're nursing what was supposed to be coffee but tastes suspiciously like burnt leather soup. Your head pounds from last night's... actually, you can't quite remember last night.*

STATUS CHECK:

The tavern is nearly empty except for a hooded figure in the corner and the half-orc bartender, Gruk, who's eyeing you with what might be concern or hunger - it's hard to tell with half-orcs.

Suddenly, the tavern door SLAMS open. A bloodied town guard stumbles in, arrow protruding from his shoulder.

"The... the caravan..." he gasps, collapsing to his knees. "Bandits... in Darkwood... they have the Merchant Prince's daughter!"

What do you do?

User: I rush over to help the guard!

Claude: You leap from your stool, immediately regretting the sudden movement as your hangover protests violently. Pushing through the head-swimming sensation, you rush to the guard's side.

*Rolling Wisdom check to assess wounds...*
[Check: Success! (13 vs DC 10)]

Your hands move with surprising competence as you examine the arrow wound. It's bad but not immediately fatal - the arrow missed major arteries but needs to come out soon. The guard grabs your wrist with bloody fingers.

"Please... someone has to help her... Lady Rosanna..." His eyes are desperate. "Twenty... maybe thirty bandits. Led by someone called Redjaw. They took her into Darkwood, toward the old ruins."

Gruk lumbers over with a bottle of something that smells strong enough to clean wounds or strip paint. "That's Captain Morris. Good man. BAD news if Redjaw's got the Merchant Prince's daughter."

The hooded figure in the corner shifts slightly, clearly listening.

**QUEST DISCOVERED: Blood and Commerce**
- Rescue Lady Rosanna from Redjaw's bandits
- Optional: Treat Captain Morris's wounds
- Reward: Unknown (but the Merchant Prince is the richest man in three kingdoms...)

The captain's breathing is getting shallower. You could try to treat him here, seek help, or immediately pursue the bandits - but every moment counts.

What's your approach?
