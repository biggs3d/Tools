# Chapter 1: Coffee to Carnage
## The Last Normal Morning

The coffee shop hummed with its usual morning chaos - espresso machines hissing, keyboards clacking, the barista calling out another butchered name. Steve sat nursing what was supposed to be a simple black coffee but tasted suspiciously like hazelnut, his red hair catching the morning sun through the window.

Then the world tilted.

Not physically - everyone else kept sipping and typing - but something fundamental shifted in his peripheral vision. The steam from his coffee cup spiraled wrong, coiling into patterns that hurt to follow. Reality stuttered, showing glimpses of stone walls and torchlight in his laptop screen's reflection.

**[Reality Distortion Detected]**
**[Integration Protocol: Initiating]**

The words floated in his vision like broken AR. His hand moved involuntarily toward the coffee cup, and when he touched it, the ceramic felt like leather-wrapped steel. For a heartbeat, it wasn't a coffee cup at all - it was the hilt of a sword.

Then she entered. Jeans, sneakers, bomber jacket - normal clothes, but her eyes were ancient. Golden. She looked directly at him, past everyone else who couldn't see her.

"Storm's coming, guerrero," she said in a voice only he could hear. "Question is - you drinking that coffee, or you coming with me before this whole place comes apart?"

Steve stood, legs shaky, trying to look casual while reality crumbled. Nobody looked up. The woman - Kaya, she'd said her name was - turned toward the door. "Walk normal. They can't see me, and they won't remember you leaving."

The ten feet to the door became thirty. The walls blurred between exposed brick and rough-hewn stone. He reached the door, and instead of the familiar street, there was a corridor of swirling mist that tasted purple and sounded like mathematics.

"The Convergence picked you, Steve. Your world's membrane got thin, and you... resonated."

## The Choice of Blood

In the darkness that followed, four lights emerged. Blue frost called to his intellect - he could feel the power of knowledge, of bending reality with will alone. But his hand moved without thought toward the red flame. Raw power. Fury. Strength.

The moment he touched it, fire raced through his veins like molten iron. His muscles screamed and reshaped. Bones cracked and reforged denser. Coffee Shop Steve got incinerated from the inside out, and something else roared to life in his place.

**[Class Acquired: BERSERKER]**

When the darkness shattered, he stood in a stone chamber, steam rising from his skin. His hands were different - same shape, but corded with muscle he didn't have thirty seconds ago. Scars he'd never earned crosshatched his forearms.

A weight materialized across his back. His hand closed around a wrapped grip, and he drew out a massive greataxe that he knew he shouldn't be able to lift this easily.

**[Greataxe of First Blood equipped]**

"Berserker," Kaya said, golden eyes approving. "Coño, that's rare for a first pick. Your soul went straight for fury."

## First Blood

The Threshold Beast unfolded from the shadows like a nightmare originating. Wolf-sized but wrong - too many joints, patches of scales mixing with fur, ember-orange eyes tracking him with predator intelligence.

Steve didn't hesitate. Didn't plan. Didn't think like Coffee Shop Steve would have.

He charged.

The beast launched at him, jaws snapping where his throat was. But he'd stepped forward, inside its leap arc. His axe swung up in a brutal arc that caught it under the jaw. Black blood arced through the air like a fountain.

They traded blows - savage, violent, beautiful in their simplicity. When the beast adapted, growing armor, Steve adapted too. When it went berserk, so did he. The fight ended with Steve on his back, using physics and leverage to turn the beast's own momentum against it.

The execution was clean. The beast dissolved into red light that rushed into him.

**[LEVEL UP! → LEVEL 2!]**
**[LEVEL UP! → LEVEL 3!]**

"Nobody - and I mean nobody - has ever gone straight for the beast on their first day," Kaya said. "Level 3 in your first five minutes. You're going to break this world, aren't you?"

Steve's hands shook, not from fear but from exhilaration. He'd never felt more alive.

Coffee was less than ten minutes ago.
