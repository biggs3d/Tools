## Scene 1: The Last Normal Moment

The coffee shop hums with its usual morning chaos - espresso machines hissing, keyboards clacking, the barista calling out another butchered name. You're Steve, nursing what was supposed to be a simple black coffee but tastes suspiciously like hazelnut. The morning sun cuts through the window, warming your red hair as you reach for your cup again.

Your fingers never touch ceramic.

The world *tilts*. Not physically - everyone else keeps sipping and typing - but something fundamental shifts in your peripheral vision. The steam from your coffee cup spirals *wrong*, coiling into patterns that hurt to follow. The laptop screen across from you flickers, showing not a spreadsheet but glimpses of... stone walls? Torchlight?

**[Reality Distortion Detected]**
**[Integration Protocol: Initiating]**

The words float in your vision like augmented reality gone wrong. Your heart hammers. Nobody else sees this. The businessman next to you keeps scrolling his phone. The barista keeps making drinks. But the steam from every cup in the shop now spirals toward you, forming whispers in a language you don't know but somehow *almost* understand.

Then you see it in the coffee shop window's reflection - not your familiar face, but a translucent overlay: a status bar hovering above your head. 

**[HP: 120/120] [Class: Undefined] [Level: 1]**

Your hand moves involuntarily toward your coffee cup, and this time when you touch it, the ceramic feels like leather-wrapped steel. For a heartbeat, it's not a coffee cup at all - it's the hilt of a sword.

The coffee shop door chimes. A woman enters wearing normal clothes - jeans, sneakers, bomber jacket - but her eyes are wrong. Ancient. Golden. She looks directly at you, past everyone else, and smiles like she knows exactly what you're seeing.

"Storm's coming, *guerrero*," she says in a voice only you can hear. "Question is - you drinking that coffee, or you coming with me before this whole place comes apart?"

The fluorescent lights flicker. In the gaps between light, you glimpse the coffee shop overlaid with something else - same layout, but stone and timber, lit by oil lamps. The other patrons flicker too, their forms occasionally showing different clothes, different faces, some with pointed ears, some with scales.

**Player**: well, super worried that everyone's going to notice me going insane, but I get up and walk towards her... she obviously has more answers than I do right now\!

## Scene 2: Blood Calls to Blood

In the darkness that followed, four lights emerged. Blue frost called to his intellect - he could feel the power of knowledge, of bending reality with will alone. But his hand moved without thought toward the red flame. Raw power. Fury. Strength.

Your hand slams into the red flame without hesitation. 

The fire doesn't burn - it *becomes* you. It races through your veins like molten iron, rewriting everything. Your muscles scream and reshape. Your bones crack and reforge denser. The polite, coffee-shop Steve gets incinerated from the inside out, and something else roars to life in his place.

**[Class Acquired: BERSERKER]**
**[HP: 120 → 150]**
**[Stamina: 100 → 130]**
**[Rage Meter: Unlocked]**

The darkness shatters like glass.

You're standing in a stone chamber, gasping, steam rising from your skin. Your hands - *fuck*, your hands are different. Same shape, but corded with muscle you didn't have thirty seconds ago. Scars you've never earned crosshatch your forearms.

Kaya leans against the wall, golden eyes approving. "Berserker. *Coño*, that's rare for a first pick. Most people think they want magic or stealth." She pushes off the wall. "Your soul went straight for fury. That's... interesting."

A weight materializes across your back. You reach up instinctively and find a leather strap. Following it down, your hand closes around a wrapped grip, and you draw out a massive greataxe that you *know* you shouldn't be able to lift this easily. The blade is notched, stained, and hums with barely contained violence.

**[Greataxe of First Blood equipped]**
**[Damage: 1d12]**
**[Special: Bloodthirst - First kill each combat heals you]**

**Player**: intellectually the blue seems obviously better, but I can't get myself to pick it. I go straight back to the Red

## Scene 3: First Blood - The Speedrun Begins

The Threshold Beast unfolds from the shadows like a nightmare originating. Start: wolf-sized, but wrong. Too many joints in the legs. Patches of scales mixing with fur. Eyes that burn ember-orange, tracking you with predator intelligence. Its health bar materializes above it:

**[Threshold Beast - Adaptive Predator]**
**[HP: 100/100]**
**[Phase 1: Stalker Form]**

It circles left. You mirror it, axe held ready. Your heartbeat slows. The rage whispers tactics: *Watch the haunches. It'll feint left, strike right. When it leaps, step INTO it, not away.*

The beast's muscles coil—and you're already moving\! The beast launches right as predicted, jaws snapping where your throat was. But you've stepped forward, inside its leap arc. Time slows as the rage takes over. Your axe swings up in a brutal arc.

**[Damage Dealt: 17]**
**[Threshold Beast HP: 83/100]**

Your axe bites deep into its flank, sending it tumbling. Black blood sprays across the sand, sizzling where it lands. The beast rolls to its feet, and you see it *changing*. The wound knits partially closed. Bone spurs erupt along its spine.

**[Adaptation Triggered: Armor Generation]**
**[Beast Armor: 1 → 2]**

"Thirty seconds\!" Kaya shouts. "It's learning your style\!"

The beast charges again, faster this time. No feint. Pure aggression matching yours. Its claws rake across your ribs, tearing through your shirt. Pain flares, but it feels *good*. It feels *real*.

**[Damage Taken: 9]**
**[HP: 111/120]**
**[Rage Building: 15%]**

The wound burns, and something new ignites in your chest. A bar appears in your peripheral vision, filling with red:

**[RAGE: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░]**

**Player**: RAGE RELEASE

## Scene 4: Breaking World Records

The beast dissolves into red light that rushes into you. Your wounds seal completely. Your muscles sing with new strength. The notifications cascade:

**[LEVEL UP\! → LEVEL 2\!]**
**[LEVEL UP\! → LEVEL 3\!]**
**[HP FULLY RESTORED]**
**[NEW MAXIMUM HP: 144]**
**[SKILL POINTS EARNED: 2]**
**[STAT POINTS EARNED: 4]**

**[SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT: THRESHOLD SLAYER]**
**[Title Earned: "The Immediate"]**
**[Bonus: +10% damage vs. higher level enemies]**

Kaya slow claps as she approaches. "¡Qué bárbaro\! Nobody—and I mean *nobody*—has ever gone straight for the beast on their first day. And that momentum reversal? *Chef's kiss.* You didn't just use berserker strength. You used berserker physics."

She kicks the dissolving remains. "Level 3 in your first five minutes. The record was Level 2 in an hour." She grins. "You're going to break this world, aren't you?"

Your hands are still shaking, but not from fear. From *exhilaration*. You've never felt more alive. The axe feels like it belongs in your hands now, like it always has.

**[Character Status Updated]**
- **Steve the Immediate**
- **Level 3 Berserker**
- **HP: 144/144**
- **Unspent Points: 4 stat, 2 skill**

## Scene 5: From Merchant to Battle Brother

Through the crowd, you spot a grizzled man in worn plate armor arguing with three nervous-looking "guards" - Level 1s with shaky hands and clean swords.

"Fifty gold for all three of you, and that's generous for—" Garrett stops mid-sentence as you approach. His eyes scan you professionally: the blood, the casual way you carry a greataxe one-handed now, the Level 3 marker floating above your head.

"Heard you need protection to Ironhold," you say. Your voice comes out different - rougher, more confident. "I'm worth more than those three combined."

Garrett looks at his current guards, then at you. "You're that berserker who just fed the Threshold Beast its own teeth." Not a question. "These three cost me 50. What's your price?"

Before you can answer, one of the nervous guards drops his sword. It clatters on the stone. He runs.

You peel off the shredded remains of your coffee shop shirt. The crowd collectively inhales. Your torso is a roadmap of fresh scars from the beast fight, still pink and sealed. But underneath - *Jesus*, when did you get *built* like this? Coffee Shop Steve had a dad bod. This is... something else. Corded muscle, functional strength, the kind of physique that comes from swinging heavy weapons and meaning it.

Garrett's mouth opens, closes. One of the remaining guards actually squeaks. The other one just... leaves. Walks away. Doesn't even ask for partial payment.

"Seventy-five gold," Garrett agrees immediately. His voice is steady - ex-soldier indeed - but his eyes show calculation. "And yes, I run a mobile supply operation. I've got gear." He pulls out a pouch, counts out 35 gold. "What do you need?"

**Player**: 75 gold, 35 upfront, although, seeing as how I just got here, I'm sure I could spend that directly back with you for a few necessities, if you have the right items. If I'm farming bandits, I'll split the loot with you too on them, I'm sure they'll be items you could sell that wouldn't interest me at this point.

## Scene 6: The Whirlwind of Gore

The rage didn't just release - it detonated.

Steve's body spun like an Olympic hammer thrower, the greataxe extending into a circle of death. The first bandit didn't just get hit - the axe went THROUGH him. His upper and lower halves parted company in a spray of crimson that painted the trees.

**[CRITICAL HIT\!]**
**[Base: 66 × Threshold Slayer 1.1 = 73 DAMAGE\!]**

The axe doesn't just hit him - it goes THROUGH him. The Level 6 bandit's health bar doesn't decrease, it VANISHES. His upper and lower halves part company in a spray of crimson that paints the tree.

But you're still spinning. The Level 5 behind you realizes too late—

**[Threshold Slayer: 24 damage\!]**

The axe catches him across the chest, lifting him off his feet. He flies backward, crashes into a tree, slides down leaving a red smear. Still alive, but barely.

The crawling Level 5 tries to scramble away faster, pure terror in his eyes—

**[Threshold Slayer: 31 damage\!]**
**[EXECUTION]**

The axe comes down like judgment. The crawling stops.

You complete the spin, stumbling slightly as the rage fades. Three bodies. Five seconds. The forest is silent except for Garrett's sword ringing against daggers.

"F-fuck this\!" The wounded leader drops his daggers. "SCATTER\!"

The three bandits break instantly. No coordination, no gathering wounded, just pure animal flight into the forest.

Garrett lowers his sword, breathing hard. "Seven hells... I've seen Level 10 Paladins do less damage."

**Player**: use it or lose it, rage release all the way, Garrett isn't pinned down yet, and I cant' be stabbed in the back if I'm charging and swinging\!

## Scene 7: Blood Brothers

The brute topples backward, a giant redwood falling. His health bar empties.

**[LEVEL 7 BRUTE DEFEATED]**
**[HOWLING SCAR BAND: ELIMINATED]**

The camp falls silent except for crackling fire and your heavy breathing. Six bodies. Complete victory.

**[LEVEL UP\!]**
**[LEVEL 4 ACHIEVED\!]**
**[HP INCREASED: 156 → 168]**
**[Current HP: 102/168 - 61%]**
**[6 Stat Points Available]**
**[3 Skill Points Available]**

Garrett leans on his sword, grinning through the blood. "Eleven bandits. A Level 3 and a Level 4 cleared eleven bandits including a Level 7." He laughs, actually laughs. "They're going to call me a liar when I report this."

Kaya strolls into the camp, somehow having appeared from nowhere. "No they won't. I recorded the whole thing with a memory crystal." She holds up a glowing gem. "The Merchants' Guild will pay extra for the footage. Probably use it for training."

She looks at you, covered in blood (yours and theirs), standing among the carnage. "Twenty minutes ago you were Level 3 fresh from coffee. Now you're Level 4 with a bandit camp cleared. *Mijo*, you're speedrunning this world."

Garrett starts checking tents. "Loot time. Guild bounty's 100 gold, plus..." He whistles. "They've been busy. Locked chest here, supplies, weapons... This is at least 200 gold worth of stolen goods."

You clap him on the shoulder. "Thanks, I mean it, without your skill here, this would have been impossible."

His weathered face shows genuine emotion. "Haven't felt this alive in years. We make a good team."

**Player**: Thanks, I mean it, without your skill here, this would have been impossible, I'll have to learn to appreciate being the distraction I guess LOL

## Scene 8: The Legend Arrives at Ironhold

The guards at the gate do a double-take. You're Level 4, covered in dried blood, wearing destroyed clothes, carrying a greataxe that's seen serious use.

"Name and business?" one asks nervously.

"Steve the Immediate. Caravan guard. Also..." You hold up the bag of ears. "Bounty collection."

The guard's eyes widen. "The... the Howling Scars? Those are their tattoos\!"

"Were," Garrett corrects cheerfully.

The city is massive compared to Threshold Station. Proper streets, three-story buildings, hundreds of people. Your Level 4 tag draws stares - most civilians are Level 1-2, guards are 3-5.

"Merchants' Guild first," you agree, trying not to notice how every guard is staring at your destroyed clothes and blood-caked skin. "I need that gold for... everything."

Garrett laughs. "Fair point. Though watching you walk through marble halls looking like a slaughterhouse explosion might be worth the price of admission."

As you approach the Merchants' Guild, you see other adventurers lounging on the steps. Level 5s and 6s mostly, looking confident in shining armor. They glance at you, see Level 4, start to dismiss you—

Then see the blood. The destroyed clothes. The greataxe that's clearly been used. The bag of ears.

"Is that...?" one whispers.
"Can't be. He's Level 4."
"But those tattoos..."

Garrett grins. "Come on, Immediate. Let's make you rich and famous. Then we get you pants that don't show your ass when you spin."

You look down. Yeah, that last fight really did a number on your wardrobe. Coffee Shop Steve would be mortified. Berserker Steve just laughs.

**[SESSION 1 COMPLETE]**
**[Bloodied but victorious, Steve enters Ironhold...]**
**[The speedrun continues next time\!]**

**Player**: hey, Claude, side questions out of character, is there a helper script for stat points?
