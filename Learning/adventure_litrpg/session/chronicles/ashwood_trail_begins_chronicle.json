      "dm_narration": "You push open the shop's door, a cluster of tiny bells chiming in discordant harmony. The interior is exactly what you'd expect\u2014cramped, dusty, and packed floor to ceiling with things that might be junk or might save your life.\n\n\"Another 'hero' come to waste my time?\" comes a raspy voice from behind a tower of scrolls. An elderly woman emerges, her eyes sharp as broken glass despite her hunched frame. She stops mid-complaint, squinting at you. \"Wait... you're that berserker. The one who dropped the Howling Scars in twenty minutes.\"\n\nShe shuffles closer, barely reaching your chest. \"Hedda Grimstone. I deal in items that actually *do* something, not the pretty garbage they sell on Main Street. You've got the look of someone who values function over flash.\"\n\nAfter examining her wares\u2014the Blooddrinker's Cord, Ironwall Bracers, Phoenix Tears, and more\u2014you strike a different deal. \"I'll take your advice on the Phoenix Tears and map, plus the smoke pellets. By the way, with the town in peak excitement as it is, what do you think the Howling Scars's Leader's eye patch would go for right now?\"\n\nHedda's eyes light with genuine amusement. She makes a quick call on her communication crystal, and within minutes Lord Pemberton's son bursts through the door, silk and velvet, gold purse already in hand. His hands shake as you produce the blood-crusted eye patch and Leader's Insignia.\n\n\"Three hundred fifty gold,\" Hedda states firmly. The lordling dumps gold without counting, clutching his trophies like holy relics. \"Could you tell me how you killed them?\" he asks, starstruck.\n\nYou lean in slightly. The boy actually steps back. \"Fast.\" That's all you say. He nods rapidly and scrambles out.",

      "dm_narration": "You slip back into the maze of alleys, taking the long way around the block. The shadows are deeper here, perfect cover as you move parallel to the East Gate. Through gaps between buildings, you catch glimpses of Henrik's wagon and Garrett's performance.\n\nMoving closer through the narrow passages, you find a good vantage point behind some empty crates. From here you can see everything\u2014the bored gate guards, other merchants preparing evening departures, and Garrett now \"helping\" Henrik load vegetables while complaining loudly about his bad knee.\n\nThe ex-Captain's eyes flick toward your position once\u2014he knows you're there. Two more merchants roll through ahead. The guards barely glance at papers, more interested in discussing tonight's tavern plans.\n\nGarrett stumbles theatrically, dropping a sack of potatoes. \"\u00a1Maldita sea\\! My back\\!\" He limps after them, conveniently ending up near your position. \"Nice shopping trip?\" he mutters. \"We're third in line. When Henrik's wagon clears, count to thirty then follow.\"\n\nYou watch the wagon pass through. The guards wave it through without checking\u2014vegetables aren't exactly contraband. Counting to thirty, you step out, walking casually toward the gate. \"Gate closes at full dark,\" one guard says without looking up. \"Won't need that long,\" you reply, walking through.\n\nAfter ten minutes on the Ashwood Trail, Garrett's head pops up from the turnip sacks. \"Clear\\! We actually pulled it off. Ghost departure, no fanfare, no complications.\" He climbs forward, brushing vegetables off. \"Sunken Mills is four hours at wagon pace. Ready to turn this milk run into a legend?\"",
