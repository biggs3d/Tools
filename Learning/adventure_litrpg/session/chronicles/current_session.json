      "dm_narration": "The coffee shop hums with its usual morning chaos - espresso machines hissing, keyboards clacking, the barista calling out another butchered name. You're Steve, nursing what was supposed to be a simple black coffee but tastes suspiciously like hazelnut. The morning sun cuts through the window, warming your red hair as you reach for your cup again.\n\nYour fingers never touch ceramic.\n\nThe world *tilts*. Not physically - everyone else keeps sipping and typing - but something fundamental shifts in your peripheral vision. The steam from your coffee cup spirals *wrong*, coiling into patterns that hurt to follow. The laptop screen across from you flickers, showing not a spreadsheet but glimpses of... stone walls? Torchlight?\n\n**[Reality Distortion Detected]**\n**[Integration Protocol: Initiating]**\n\nThe words float in your vision like augmented reality gone wrong. Your heart hammers. Nobody else sees this. The businessman next to you keeps scrolling his phone. The barista keeps making drinks. But the steam from every cup in the shop now spirals toward you, forming whispers in a language you don't know but somehow *almost* understand.\n\nThen you see it in the coffee shop window's reflection - not your familiar face, but a translucent overlay: a status bar hovering above your head. \n\n**[HP: 120/120] [Class: Undefined] [Level: 1]**\n\nYour hand moves involuntarily toward your coffee cup, and this time when you touch it, the ceramic feels like leather-wrapped steel. For a heartbeat, it's not a coffee cup at all - it's the hilt of a sword.\n\nThe coffee shop door chimes. A woman enters wearing normal clothes - jeans, sneakers, bomber jacket - but her eyes are wrong. Ancient. Golden. She looks directly at you, past everyone else, and smiles like she knows exactly what you're seeing.\n\n\"Storm's coming, *guerrero*,\" she says in a voice only you can hear. \"Question is - you drinking that coffee, or you coming with me before this whole place comes apart?\"\n\nThe fluorescent lights flicker. In the gaps between light, you glimpse the coffee shop overlaid with something else - same layout, but stone and timber, lit by oil lamps. The other patrons flicker too, their forms occasionally showing different clothes, different faces, some with pointed ears, some with scales.",

      "dm_narration": "In the darkness that followed, four lights emerged. Blue frost called to his intellect - he could feel the power of knowledge, of bending reality with will alone. But his hand moved without thought toward the red flame. Raw power. Fury. Strength.\n\nYour hand slams into the red flame without hesitation. \n\nThe fire doesn't burn - it *becomes* you. It races through your veins like molten iron, rewriting everything. Your muscles scream and reshape. Your bones crack and reforge denser. The polite, coffee-shop Steve gets incinerated from the inside out, and something else roars to life in his place.\n\n**[Class Acquired: BERSERKER]**\n**[HP: 120 \u2192 150]**\n**[Stamina: 100 \u2192 130]**\n**[Rage Meter: Unlocked]**\n\nThe darkness shatters like glass.\n\nYou're standing in a stone chamber, gasping, steam rising from your skin. Your hands - *fuck*, your hands are different. Same shape, but corded with muscle you didn't have thirty seconds ago. Scars you've never earned crosshatch your forearms.\n\nKaya leans against the wall, golden eyes approving. \"Berserker. *Co\u00f1o*, that's rare for a first pick. Most people think they want magic or stealth.\" She pushes off the wall. \"Your soul went straight for fury. That's... interesting.\"\n\nA weight materializes across your back. You reach up instinctively and find a leather strap. Following it down, your hand closes around a wrapped grip, and you draw out a massive greataxe that you *know* you shouldn't be able to lift this easily. The blade is notched, stained, and hums with barely contained violence.\n\n**[Greataxe of First Blood equipped]**\n**[Damage: 1d12]**\n**[Special: Bloodthirst - First kill each combat heals you]**",

      "dm_narration": "The Threshold Beast unfolds from the shadows like a nightmare originating. Start: wolf-sized, but wrong. Too many joints in the legs. Patches of scales mixing with fur. Eyes that burn ember-orange, tracking you with predator intelligence. Its health bar materializes above it:\n\n**[Threshold Beast - Adaptive Predator]**\n**[HP: 100/100]**\n**[Phase 1: Stalker Form]**\n\nIt circles left. You mirror it, axe held ready. Your heartbeat slows. The rage whispers tactics: *Watch the haunches. It'll feint left, strike right. When it leaps, step INTO it, not away.*\n\nThe beast's muscles coil\u2014and you're already moving\\! The beast launches right as predicted, jaws snapping where your throat was. But you've stepped forward, inside its leap arc. Time slows as the rage takes over. Your axe swings up in a brutal arc.\n\n**[Damage Dealt: 17]**\n**[Threshold Beast HP: 83/100]**\n\nYour axe bites deep into its flank, sending it tumbling. Black blood sprays across the sand, sizzling where it lands. The beast rolls to its feet, and you see it *changing*. The wound knits partially closed. Bone spurs erupt along its spine.\n\n**[Adaptation Triggered: Armor Generation]**\n**[Beast Armor: 1 \u2192 2]**\n\n\"Thirty seconds\\!\" Kaya shouts. \"It's learning your style\\!\"\n\nThe beast charges again, faster this time. No feint. Pure aggression matching yours. Its claws rake across your ribs, tearing through your shirt. Pain flares, but it feels *good*. It feels *real*.\n\n**[Damage Taken: 9]**\n**[HP: 111/120]**\n**[Rage Building: 15%]**\n\nThe wound burns, and something new ignites in your chest.

You used berserker physics.\"\n\nShe kicks the dissolving remains. \"Level 3 in your first five minutes. The record was Level 2 in an hour.\" She grins. \"You're going to break this world, aren't you?\"\n\nYour hands are still shaking, but not from fear. From *exhilaration*.

      "dm_narration": "Through the crowd, you spot a grizzled man in worn plate armor arguing with three nervous-looking \"guards\" - Level 1s with shaky hands and clean swords.\n\n\"Fifty gold for all three of you, and that's generous for\u2014\" Garrett stops mid-sentence as you approach. His eyes scan you professionally: the blood, the casual way you carry a greataxe one-handed now, the Level 3 marker floating above your head.\n\n\"Heard you need protection to Ironhold,\" you say. Your voice comes out different - rougher, more confident. \"I'm worth more than those three combined.\"\n\nGarrett looks at his current guards, then at you. \"You're that berserker who just fed the Threshold Beast its own teeth.\" Not a question. \"These three cost me 50. What's your price?\"\n\nBefore you can answer, one of the nervous guards drops his sword. It clatters on the stone. He runs.\n\nYou peel off the shredded remains of your coffee shop shirt. The crowd collectively inhales. Your torso is a roadmap of fresh scars from the beast fight, still pink and sealed. But underneath - *Jesus*, when did you get *built* like this? Coffee Shop Steve had a dad bod. This is... something else. Corded muscle, functional strength, the kind of physique that comes from swinging heavy weapons and meaning it.\n\nGarrett's mouth opens, closes. One of the remaining guards actually squeaks. The other one just... leaves. Walks away. Doesn't even ask for partial payment.\n\n\"Seventy-five gold,\" Garrett agrees immediately. His voice is steady - ex-soldier indeed - but his eyes show calculation. \"And yes, I run a mobile supply operation. I've got gear.\" He pulls out a pouch, counts out 35 gold. \"What do you need?\"",
      "player_response": "75 gold, 35 upfront, although, seeing as how I just got here, I'm sure I could spend that directly back with you for a few necessities, if you have the right items.

      "dm_narration": "The rage didn't just release - it detonated.\n\nSteve's body spun like an Olympic hammer thrower, the greataxe extending into a circle of death. The first bandit didn't just get hit - the axe went THROUGH him. His upper and lower halves parted company in a spray of crimson that painted the trees.\n\n**[CRITICAL HIT\\!]**\n**[Base: 66 \u00d7 Threshold Slayer 1.1 = 73 DAMAGE\\!]**\n\nThe axe doesn't just hit him - it goes THROUGH him. The Level 6 bandit's health bar doesn't decrease, it VANISHES. His upper and lower halves part company in a spray of crimson that paints the tree.\n\nBut you're still spinning. The Level 5 behind you realizes too late\u2014\n\n**[Threshold Slayer: 24 damage\\!]**\n\nThe axe catches him across the chest, lifting him off his feet. He flies backward, crashes into a tree, slides down leaving a red smear. Still alive, but barely.\n\nThe crawling Level 5 tries to scramble away faster, pure terror in his eyes\u2014\n\n**[Threshold Slayer: 31 damage\\!]**\n**[EXECUTION]**\n\nThe axe comes down like judgment. The crawling stops.\n\nYou complete the spin, stumbling slightly as the rage fades. Three bodies. Five seconds. The forest is silent except for Garrett's sword ringing against daggers.\n\n\"F-fuck this\\!\" The wounded leader drops his daggers. \"SCATTER\\!\"\n\nThe three bandits break instantly. No coordination, no gathering wounded, just pure animal flight into the forest.\n\nGarrett lowers his sword, breathing hard. \"Seven hells... I've seen Level 10 Paladins do less damage.\"",

I recorded the whole thing with a memory crystal.\" She holds up a glowing gem. \"The Merchants' Guild will pay extra for the footage. Probably use it for training.\"\n\nShe looks at you, covered in blood (yours and theirs), standing among the carnage. \"Twenty minutes ago you were Level 3 fresh from coffee. Now you're Level 4 with a bandit camp cleared. *Mijo*, you're speedrunning this world.\"\n\nGarrett starts checking tents. \"Loot time. Guild bounty's 100 gold, plus...\" He whistles. \"They've been busy. Locked chest here, supplies, weapons... This is at least 200 gold worth of stolen goods.\"\n\nYou clap him on the shoulder. \"Thanks, I mean it, without your skill here, this would have been impossible.\"\n\nHis weathered face shows genuine emotion. \"Haven't felt this alive in years.

Also...\" You hold up the bag of ears. \"Bounty collection.\"\n\nThe guard's eyes widen. \"The... the Howling Scars? Those are their tattoos\\!\"\n\n\"Were,\" Garrett corrects cheerfully.\n\nThe city is massive compared to Threshold Station. Proper streets, three-story buildings, hundreds of people. Your Level 4 tag draws stares - most civilians are Level 1-2, guards are 3-5.\n\n\"Merchants' Guild first,\" you agree, trying not to notice how every guard is staring at your destroyed clothes and blood-caked skin. \"I need that gold for... everything.\"\n\nGarrett laughs. \"Fair point. Though watching you walk through marble halls looking like a slaughterhouse explosion might be worth the price of admission.\"\n\nAs you approach the Merchants' Guild, you see other adventurers lounging on the steps. Level 5s and 6s mostly, looking confident in shining armor. They glance at you, see Level 4, start to dismiss you\u2014\n\nThen see the blood. The destroyed clothes. The greataxe that's clearly been used. The bag of ears.\n\n\"Is that...?\" one whispers.\n\"Can't be. He's Level 4.\"\n\"But those tattoos...\"\n\nGarrett grins. \"Come on, Immediate. Let's make you rich and famous. Then we get you pants that don't show your ass when you spin.\"\n\nYou look down. Yeah, that last fight really did a number on your wardrobe.
