## Scene 1: Strategic Withdrawal

Over ales at the Drunken Griffin, Garrett and Steve plotted their escape from Ironhold's sudden fame. The plan: disappear east on the Ashwood Trail, clearing three crisis zones - the Sunken Mills, Crow's Rest village, and the Iron Mines - to level up before facing Viktor 'The Red Wolf' and his forty Scarred Wolves. Three days of hard fighting to transform from Level 4 upstart to Level 6-7 nightmare.

**Player**: Nothing like a little intimidation and ghosting out to keep the Wolves uncertain about what's coming for them.

```
planning: strategic withdrawal
goal: reach Level 6-7

## Scene 2: A Promise to Return

Steve left a hasty note for young Tom with Sara: 'Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of. ~ Steve'. The boy who lost his guard father to sickness would have to wait for his hero's return. Sara promised to spread false rumors about heading south to Goldport, while Steve and Garrett prepared to vanish east within the hour.

**Player**: I didn't think of that. Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of.

## Scene 3: Beyond the Tutorial

As Steve slipped out the back door of the Drunken Griffin, Sara delivered one final message: Kaya had been there that morning, saying 'the real game begins when you leave the tutorial city.' With energy thrumming through his veins and the promise of real adventure ahead, the Speedrun Berserker vanished into Ironhold's back alleys, ready to forge his legend one brutal battle at a time.

**Player**: Thanks again, mind if I use your back door again?
