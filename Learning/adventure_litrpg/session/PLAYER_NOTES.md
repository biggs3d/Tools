## Session Management Tips

### Before Each Session
1. Check NEXT_SESSION.md for continuity
2. Run status check to verify character state
3. Review last chapter for narrative flow

### During Session
- Let combat flow naturally - don't overthink mechanics
- Embrace creative solutions (physics tricks, environmental usage)
- Keep pushing boundaries - Steve is a speedrunner at heart
- Build on NPC relationships (especially Garrett and Kaya)

### After Session
- Save chapters to session/chapters/ for novelization
- Update NEXT_SESSION.md with key points
- Note any cool combat moves or memorable moments

- Short-term: Level 6-7 (for Scarred Wolves raid)
- Mid-term: Level 10 (regional threat level)
- Long-term: Level 15+ (legendary status)

## Memorable Quotes
- "Coffee was less than ten minutes ago"
- "Physics meets fury"
- "Coffee Shop Steve would be mortified. Berserker Steve just laughs"
- "You're speedrunning this world"

## Technical Enhancements

### Custom Scripts to Consider
1. **Combat Simulator** - Test different weapon/armor combinations
2. **XP Calculator** - Track progress to next level
3. **Inventory Manager** - Better item tracking
4. **Relationship Tracker** - NPC disposition system

### Story Formatting
- Keep chapters ~1000-2000 words for readability
- Include stat blocks at major progression points
- Preserve the best combat descriptions verbatim

## Session Scheduling
- Each session = roughly 1-2 hours real time
- In-game time moves faster during combat
- Consider "downtime" sessions for character development
- Balance combat with exploration/social encounters

## The Core Loop
1. **Challenge appears** â†’ Steve sees physics solution
2. **Combat begins** â†’ Rage builds, creativity flows  
3. **Turning point** â†’ Rampage/Rage Release/Innovation
4. **Victory** â†’ Level up, loot, reputation grows
5. **Quiet moment** â†’ Coffee Shop Steve surfaces briefly
6. **Next challenge** â†’ The cycle continues

## Remember
This is YOUR story. Steve is breaking the world's rules because he doesn't know them yet. Every combat is a physics experiment. Every level up is a new record. Every NPC interaction builds the legend.

Keep pushing boundaries. Keep breaking expectations. Keep speedrunning.
