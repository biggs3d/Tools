[USER]
- too many different ways of saving progress, yet not expansive enough to write a book yet, 
nor succinct enough to keep in context for the agent not to make mistakes
- inventory management is good, but items can be a single-line entry in the main data file, high customization
- scenes, relationship net of connections, all captured in the main data file
- all character numbers, from gold to health, should be in a single place
- an all-purpose math function that can be used to add, subtract numbers or array of numbers
- the agent should be able to edit all the data files directly; it's precise and smart enough to make that easier than
  the complexity of scripts that may limit creativity and actions at this stage
- we need to have a short list of things that the agent does every "turn" of narrative and user response/interaction
    - the current narrative and user interaction should be backed up every turn in specific detail to a separate file
    - the agent should be able to edit this directly if the user says something's incorrect, not just append to it
- we need to have a short list of things that the agent does every scene/session
    - the narrative entries should be copied to another folder set aside for later authorship
    - the narrative entries should be summarized into the main story data file as an overview entry:
      succinct enough the file can be kept in context for the agent, yet also holding every fact needed for the future
    - These entries could be under "acts" and "chapters" for later compacting themselves if the context grows too large over time, but no worries currently
- is the `attack` function in the combat script still needed versus a simple dice roll function? or does the structure assist
the agent enough to keep it? do we keep it but with more parameters for the agent to use to provide structure?
- the xp system has enough math that it should be a function that can be called with parameters
