# Chapter 2: Blood and Commerce
## The Negotiation

The market gave Steve a WIDE berth. He was still steaming slightly, muscles enlarged from the rage release, black beast blood splattered across his torn shirt.

"THAT'S the one!" someone whispered. "Killed it in under a minute!"

Through the crowd, he spotted Garrett - grizzled, worn plate armor, arguing with nervous Level 1 guards. The man stopped mid-sentence as Steve approached, eyes scanning professionally: the blood, the casual one-handed carry of a greataxe, the Level 3 marker.

"You're that berserker who just fed the Threshold Beast its own teeth."

"75 gold, 35 upfront," Steve said, his voice rougher than before. "Although, seeing as how I just got here, I'm sure I could spend that directly back with you for necessities."

Garrett's eyes tracked as Steve peeled off his shredded shirt. The crowd collectively inhaled. His torso was already a roadmap of fresh scars, corded with muscle that Coffee Shop Steve never had.

The guards squeaked. One left. Then another.

"Seventy-five gold," Garrett agreed immediately, counting out the coins. "And yes, I've got gear."

## The Darkwood Ambush

The forest swallowed the caravan whole. Ancient trees created a canopy so thick it might as well be twilight. Then came the whistle. Sharp. Commanding.

The Razorback Scout dropped from the trees - Level 6, twin daggers dripping green poison.

"Toll time, Garrett! Half your cargo, nobody bleeds."

The bandit's grin faltered when he saw Steve. Saw the blood stains. The Threshold Slayer title. The way he was smiling.

Steve didn't wait for negotiations to break down. He exploded off the wagon seat like a human cannonball, 200+ pounds of berserker flying horizontally through the air. The physics were beautiful - using the wagon's springs, his mass, the element of surprise.

The axe caught the scout mid-chest while Steve was still rotating. The impact was tremendous.

Then the other Razorbacks dropped from the trees. Six versus one.

"Six versus two," Garrett corrected, dropping beside him with his sword drawn.

## The Whirlwind

The rage didn't just release - it detonated.

Steve's body spun like an Olympic hammer thrower, the greataxe extending into a circle of death. The first bandit didn't just get hit - the axe went THROUGH him. His upper and lower halves parted company in a spray of crimson that painted the trees.

Still spinning, the axe caught the flanking bandit across the chest, lifting him off his feet. The crawling one tried to scramble away faster—

The axe came down like judgment.

Three bodies. Five seconds. The forest went silent.

"F-fuck this!" The wounded leader dropped his daggers. "SCATTER!"

**[INTIMIDATING PRESENCE: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS]**

They ran. No coordination, no gathering wounded, just pure animal flight into the forest.

Garrett lowered his sword, breathing hard. "Seven hells... I've seen Level 10 Paladins do less damage."

## The Hunt

"Garrett, ever more than one attack? What's your advice on hunting those down?"

Garrett's weathered face split into a genuine smile. "You know what? It's been five years since I left the service. Five years of playing it safe."

He took the poison daggers Steve offered, testing their weight with practiced ease. His stance shifted - suddenly he didn't look like a merchant. He looked like Captain Garrett Ironside, Third Legion, Retired.

They moved through the forest like death incarnate. Found the bandit camp. Six more enemies arguing about what to do.

"I can take both archers with surprise throws," Garrett whispered.

Steve nodded. "Lob a smoke bomb ahead of me as they react."

The attack was poetry. Garrett's daggers flew. The smoke bomb detonated. Steve burst through like a demon, axe already swinging. 

The Level 7 brute charged him - massive, heavy armor, two-handed sword. They danced around tents and trees, Steve using his smaller size and agility against the giant's strength. When the brute raised his sword for a killing blow, Garrett's voice cut through:

"SLAYER! DOWN!"

Steve dropped flat. A poison dagger whistled over his head, took the brute in the eye.

Together, they brought the giant down like a redwood falling.

**[LEVEL UP! → LEVEL 4!]**

## The Spoils of War

The camp was theirs. Six pairs of ears worth 30 gold. Howling Scar elimination bounty: 100 gold. Recovered stolen goods: 200+ gold.

Steve collected trophies - the brute's eye patch, the leader's insignia. His hands moved with practiced efficiency, like he'd been doing this for years instead of an hour.

"That spin move in the smoke?" Garrett was grinning like he was twenty years younger. "Haven't felt this alive in years. We make a good team."

Steve clapped him on the shoulder. "Thanks. I mean it. Without your skill here, this would have been impossible."

He looked down at himself and laughed. His shirt was more holes than fabric. His pants had sword slashes that were getting indecent.

"Let's head to Ironhold," he said. "I need to bandage a few... things. And I could use some new pants. Shirt's probably hopeless."

As they loaded up the wagon with loot and glory, Steve caught his reflection in polished steel. Red hair wild, scarred arms, leather armor that had seen battles he hadn't fought yet. Level 4 glowing above his head like a crown.

Coffee Shop Steve was dead. Long live Steve the Immediate.

## Ironhold Gates

The guards at the gate did a double-take. Level 4, covered in dried blood, wearing destroyed clothes, carrying a greataxe that had seen serious use.

"Name and business?"

"Steve the Immediate. Caravan guard. Also..." He held up the bag of ears. "Bounty collection."

The guard's eyes widened. "The... the Howling Scars? Those are their tattoos!"

"Were," Garrett corrected cheerfully.

One hour. From coffee shop to Level 4. From barista to berserker. From Steve to The Immediate.

And the adventure had just begun.
