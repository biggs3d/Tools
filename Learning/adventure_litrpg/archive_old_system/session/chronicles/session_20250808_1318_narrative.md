## Scene 1: Strategic Withdrawal

Over ales at the Drunken Griffin, Garrett and Steve plotted their escape from Ironhold's sudden fame. The plan: disappear east on the Ashwood Trail, clearing three crisis zones - the Sunken Mills, Crow's Rest village, and the Iron Mines - to level up before facing Viktor 'The Red Wolf' and his forty Scarred Wolves. Three days of hard fighting to transform from Level 4 upstart to Level 6-7 nightmare.

**Player**: Nothing like a little intimidation and ghosting out to keep the Wolves uncertain about what's coming for them.

```
planning: strategic withdrawal
goal: reach Level 6-7

## Scene 2: A Promise to Return

Steve left a hasty note for young Tom with Sara: 'Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of. ~ Steve'. The boy who lost his guard father to sickness would have to wait for his hero's return. Sara promised to spread false rumors about heading south to Goldport, while Steve and Garrett prepared to vanish east within the hour.

**Player**: I didn't think of that. Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of.

## Scene 3: Beyond the Tutorial

As Steve slipped out the back door of the Drunken Griffin, Sara delivered one final message: Kaya had been there that morning, saying 'the real game begins when you leave the tutorial city.' With energy thrumming through his veins and the promise of real adventure ahead, the Speedrun Berserker vanished into Ironhold's back alleys, ready to forge his legend one brutal battle at a time.

**Player**: Thanks again, mind if I use your back door again?

## Scene 1: The Merchant's Son

You push open the shop's door, a cluster of tiny bells chiming in discordant harmony. The interior is exactly what you'd expect—cramped, dusty, and packed floor to ceiling with things that might be junk or might save your life.

"Another 'hero' come to waste my time?" comes a raspy voice from behind a tower of scrolls. An elderly woman emerges, her eyes sharp as broken glass despite her hunched frame. She stops mid-complaint, squinting at you. "Wait... you're that berserker. The one who dropped the Howling Scars in twenty minutes."

She shuffles closer, barely reaching your chest. "Hedda Grimstone. I deal in items that actually *do* something, not the pretty garbage they sell on Main Street. You've got the look of someone who values function over flash."

After examining her wares—the Blooddrinker's Cord, Ironwall Bracers, Phoenix Tears, and more—you strike a different deal. "I'll take your advice on the Phoenix Tears and map, plus the smoke pellets. By the way, with the town in peak excitement as it is, what do you think the Howling Scars's Leader's eye patch would go for right now?"

Hedda's eyes light with genuine amusement. She makes a quick call on her communication crystal, and within minutes Lord Pemberton's son bursts through the door, silk and velvet, gold purse already in hand. His hands shake as you produce the blood-crusted eye patch and Leader's Insignia.

"Three hundred fifty gold," Hedda states firmly. The lordling dumps gold without counting, clutching his trophies like holy relics. "Could you tell me how you killed them?" he asks, starstruck.

You lean in slightly. The boy actually steps back. "Fast." That's all you say. He nods rapidly and scrambles out.

**Player**: Sold the trophies for 350 gold, will take Phoenix Tears, map, and smoke pellets

```

## Scene 2: Strategic Exit

You slip back into the maze of alleys, taking the long way around the block. The shadows are deeper here, perfect cover as you move parallel to the East Gate. Through gaps between buildings, you catch glimpses of Henrik's wagon and Garrett's performance.

Moving closer through the narrow passages, you find a good vantage point behind some empty crates. From here you can see everything—the bored gate guards, other merchants preparing evening departures, and Garrett now "helping" Henrik load vegetables while complaining loudly about his bad knee.

The ex-Captain's eyes flick toward your position once—he knows you're there. Two more merchants roll through ahead. The guards barely glance at papers, more interested in discussing tonight's tavern plans.

Garrett stumbles theatrically, dropping a sack of potatoes. "¡Maldita sea\! My back\!" He limps after them, conveniently ending up near your position. "Nice shopping trip?" he mutters. "We're third in line. When Henrik's wagon clears, count to thirty then follow."

You watch the wagon pass through. The guards wave it through without checking—vegetables aren't exactly contraband. Counting to thirty, you step out, walking casually toward the gate. "Gate closes at full dark," one guard says without looking up. "Won't need that long," you reply, walking through.

After ten minutes on the Ashwood Trail, Garrett's head pops up from the turnip sacks. "Clear\! We actually pulled it off. Ghost departure, no fanfare, no complications." He climbs forward, brushing vegetables off. "Sunken Mills is four hours at wagon pace. Ready to turn this milk run into a legend?"

**Player**: Definitely\! Time to hit the road
