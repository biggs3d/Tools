## Scene 1: Physics Meets Fury

The wagon groans as you explode off it like a human cannonball. The horses scream. Garrett curses. The bandit's eyes go
wide as 200+ pounds of berserker comes at him horizontally, greataxe already swinging.

**[INTIMIDATING PRESENCE: SUCCESS]**
**[Razorback Scout: FROZEN IN FEAR - 1 second]**

One second. That's all you need.

Your launch is perfect. Your flight is beautiful. Your landing... less so.

You clip the lead horse's head with your knee, sending yourself into an uncontrolled spin. But you're a berserker -
uncontrolled is just another word for *unpredictable*. The bandit breaks his freeze just in time to see you spinning at
him like a bladed tornado.

**Player**: I didn't put points into dexterity not to use them\! They may be higher level, but not by much, and they're
not dodging a sword thrust, they're dodging a roaring axe swing\!
