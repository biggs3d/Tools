# Content Directory - Living Reference Library

## IMPORTANT: These Files Are Optional References!

The JSON files in this directory are **starter examples and inspiration**, not required content. Think of them as:

- **Convenience templates** when you need something quickly
- **Consistency references** if the player revisits familiar enemies
- **Fallback options** when improvisation needs support
- **Format examples** for creating new content on the fly

## Creative Freedom Guidelines

### You SHOULD:
- **Create unique content** whenever the narrative calls for it
- **Modify existing stats** to fit the situation (boss goblin? Triple the HP!)
- **Invent entirely new categories** (psychic parasites, dream thieves, etc.)
- **Ignore these files completely** if they don't fit your story

### You SHOULD NOT:
- Feel constrained to only use what's defined here
- Worry about "breaking canon" - each adventure is its own world
- Check these files before creating something new
- Treat any of this as official or required

## Examples of Narrative-Driven Creation

**Scenario**: Player enters an ancient library
- Don't look for "library enemies" in bestiary.json
- Create "Ink Elementals" (hp: 3d6, damage: 1d8 + blindness effect)
- Invent "Paper Golems" that reform unless burned
- Add "The Librarian" - unique NPC/boss not in any file

**Scenario**: Player needs a reward for a unique quest
- Don't limit yourself to items.json
- Create "Memoria Crystal" - stores one memory to relive later
- Invent "Songbird Compass" - points toward what you most desire
- Design "Paradox Coin" - always lands on the side you didn't call

## The Golden Rule

**If it makes the story better, create it.**

Stats can be invented on the spot:
- Small/weak: 1-2d6 HP, 1d4 damage
- Medium/standard: 3-4d8 HP, 1d6-1d8 damage  
- Large/strong: 5-6d10 HP, 2d6+ damage
- Boss/unique: Whatever serves the drama!

## File Purposes

- **adventure_starts.json**: Opening scenarios for inspiration
- **bestiary.json**: Common enemy templates (modify freely!)
- **items.json**: Equipment examples (invent new ones!)
- **spells.json**: Magic templates (every mage is unique!)

Remember: These files support your creativity, they don't limit it!
