# LitRPG Adventure System üé≤‚öîÔ∏è

A narrative-first LitRPG framework for Claude Code that balances compelling storytelling with meaningful progression mechanics. Live your own progression fantasy adventure!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Interactive setup
python3 quickstart.py

# Option 2: Direct to Claude
"Start a new LitRPG adventure. I want to be a [character concept]"
```

## What Is This?

This system lets you play immersive, narrative-driven RPG adventures with Claude as your Dungeon Master. Unlike traditional tabletop systems:

- **Story drives everything** - No rigid movement or action rules
- **Numbers that matter** - HP, damage, and XP create real tension
- **Living world** - NPCs have lives, time passes, consequences ripple
- **Your choices shape the narrative** - No predetermined path
- **Cinematic combat** - Visceral descriptions, not just dice rolls

Think less "D&D with strict rules" and more "living inside a Cradle or Dungeon Crawler Carl novel."

## Core Philosophy

- **Numbers for Impact**: Python handles HP, damage, XP, skill checks
- **Narrative for Everything Else**: Movement, time, and interactions flow naturally
- **Creative Freedom First**: Every adventure can be unique
- **Collaborative Storytelling**: Claude enhances your ideas, doesn't restrict them

## Player Commands

During your adventure, you can say:

- **STATUS** - View your character sheet
- **INVENTORY** - Check your items  
- **JOURNAL** - Review recent events
- **REST** - Recover resources
- **SAVE POINT** - Create a checkpoint

## How It Works

1. **You describe** what you want to do
2. **Claude narrates** the world's response cinematically
3. **Python calculates** any numerical outcomes (damage, healing, XP)
4. **The story continues** based on consequences

> *The autumn rain pounds against the tavern windows as you nurse your third ale. The Rusty Tankard isn't much, but it's dry. Your fingers unconsciously check your daggers - old habits from the thieves' guild you'd rather forget.*
>
> *Before you can order another drink, the tavern door SLAMS open. A young woman stumbles in, blood seeping through her fingers pressed against her side. "Please," she gasps, "they took my brother to the old mine. The cultists... they're going to..."*
>
> *She collapses.*
>
> **[HP: 80/80 | MP: 50/50 | Stamina: 120/120]**
>
> What do you do?
