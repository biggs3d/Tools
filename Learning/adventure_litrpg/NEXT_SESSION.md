## DM Notes for Next Session
### Prepared Encounters

### Potential Complications
- Other adventurers jealous of rapid advancement
- Scarred Wolves might send assassins once they learn
- Noble might try to hire/control the "Immediate"

### Rewards Ready
- For bounty collection: 330g minimum plus reputation
- Hidden discovery at Adventurers' Hall: Special berserker trainer interested in Steve

## Opening Options for Next Session

### Option A: Continue Immediately
"The guard's eyes widen as he recognizes the Razorback tattoos on the ears you're carrying. 'By the gods... you're the one? The whole gatehouse is talking about it - someone said a Level 3 wiped out the Howling Scars!' Behind you, Garrett chuckles..."

### Option B: Short Time Skip
"You wake in the Drunken Griffin Inn, finally clean, bandaged, and in fresh clothes. The events of yesterday feel like a fever dream - except for the Level 4 tag floating above your head and the 500+ gold in your purse. Garrett knocks on your door..."

### Option C: Scene Transition
"The Merchants' Guild erupts in chaos as you dump nine pairs of tattooed ears on the marble counter. 'THAT'S the Howling Scars lieutenant!' someone shouts. The guild master himself emerges from his office..."

## Important Reminders
- **Tone**: Fast-paced, visceral combat, humor through culture shock
- **Player Preferences**: Physics-based creative combat, speedrun mentality
- **Avoid**: Slow grinding, excessive downtime
- **Emphasize**: Reputation building, Steve's coffee shop → berserker contrast

## Technical Notes
- Last checkpoint: After bandit camp clear
- Files to update: session_log.md, character_sheet.md, current_scene.md
- Flags to check: `python3 system/game_engine.py flag --get "howling_scars_defeated"`

**For Claude**: When resuming, provide a "Previously on..." recap, then continue from the Current Situation above. Steve is at Ironhold's gates with Garrett, ready to collect bounties and explore the city. Maintain the fast pacing and Steve's mix of coffee shop normalcy with berserker instincts.
