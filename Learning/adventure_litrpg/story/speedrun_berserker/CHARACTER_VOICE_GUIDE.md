# Character Voice & Speech Pattern Guide

## Purpose
This guide preserves character voices for consistent roleplay across sessions. The raw narrative files contain full dialogue, but these patterns help maintain personality even in new situations.

## Major Characters

### Kaya - The Mysterious Guide
**Core Pattern**: Modern casual speech peppered with Spanish, always knowing more than she reveals
**Tone**: Amused, slightly condescending but affectionate, like watching a talented child
**Spanish Usage**: 
- *guerrero* (warrior) - her nickname for Steve
- *mijo* (my son) - when being protective/affectionate  
- *coño* - mild profanity/surprise
- *¡Qué bárbaro!* - amazement at Steve's actions
**Speech Examples**:
- "Storm's coming, *guerrero*. Question is - you drinking that coffee?"
- "*Mijo*, you're speedrunning this world."
- Never explains how she appears/disappears
- Speaks in certainties about the future

### Garrett Ironside - The Battle Brother

**Tone**: Breathless enthusiasm, nervous around his hero
**Youth Markers**:
- Run-on sentences when excited
- "Did you really...?" questions
- Comparing everything to legends/stories
- Slightly too formal when trying to be respectful
**Context**: Lost guard father to sickness, sees Steve as role model

### Henrik - The Nervous Driver
**Core Pattern**: Working-class pragmatism mixed with fear
**Tone**: Trying to stay calm, obviously scared

## Minor Character Templates

### Guards/Soldiers

## Steve's Evolution

### Coffee Shop Steve (Internal Monologue)
- Analytical: "This doesn't make physics sense..."
- Self-deprecating: "Coffee Shop Steve would be mortified"
- Modern references: "Like an Olympic hammer thrower"

### Berserker Steve (Actions/Dialogue)
- Direct: "I'm worth more than those three combined"
- Confident: Physical actions speak louder
- Humor emerges in violence: Laughs at destroyed clothes

## Maintaining Voice Consistency

1. **Read recent raw files** before sessions for voice refresh
2. **Note new speech patterns** as they emerge
3. **Keep cultural markers** consistent (Kaya's Spanish, Garrett's military)
4. **Let relationships evolve** speech (formal → casual as trust builds)

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before writing dialogue, ask:
- What's this character's education/background?
- What's their current emotional state?
- How do they view Steve?
- What verbal tics do they have?
- How would they say this differently from others?

## Examples of Voice Distinction

**Same Information, Different Voices**:

**Kaya**: "*Mijo*, the Scarred Wolves? They're already moving. Better hurry, *sí*?"

**Garrett**: "Intel says the Wolves are mobilizing. We should move out within the hour."

**Tom**: "Did you hear? Did you? The Scarred Wolves - they're coming! You're gonna fight them, right?"

**Henrik**: "Begging your pardon, but if those Wolves are coming, I'd like my payment now."

This distinction makes each character memorable and maintains immersion across sessions.
