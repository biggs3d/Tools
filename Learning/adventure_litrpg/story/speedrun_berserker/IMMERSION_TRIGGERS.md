## The Golden Rule

**Don't list these mechanically. Weave them naturally:**

❌ Bad: "You enter the forest. It smells like pine. Birds are singing."

✅ Good: "Pine sap thick in your nostrils, you push through branches still wet with morning dew. Something that might be a bird - or might not - calls out in the canopy above."

## Quick Selection Guide

**For Every Scene, Pick:**
1. One smell (strongest memory trigger)
2. One unexpected sound
3. One physical sensation
4. One visual that's "wrong"

This creates immediate immersion without overwhelming description.

Remember: Players don't just want to know what happens - they want to FEEL it happen.
