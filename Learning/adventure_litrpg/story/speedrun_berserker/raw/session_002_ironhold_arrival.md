# Session 02: Ironhold - Fame, Fortune, and the Vanishing Act

## Scene 9: Blood Money at the Merchants Guild

The Merchants Guild fell silent as Steve pushed through the heavy oak doors, blood-soaked and carrying nine pairs of tattooed ears. The marble halls echoed with whispers as adventurers and merchants alike turned to stare at the Level 4 berserker who looked like he'd bathed in gore.

Cromwell emerged from his office like a calculating predator. Gold rings on every finger, purple robes that cost more than most houses, and eyes that counted profit margins in every glance. The guild master's smile could have sold sand in a desert.

"Well, well. The Immediate, I presume?" His voice dripped honey over steel. "I've already heard three different versions of your morning's work. Each more impossible than the last."

The scale tipped dramatically under the weight of the trophies. Nine pairs of ears, each tattooed with the Howling Scars' mark. Cromwell's eyebrows climbed toward his receding hairline.

"Three hundred and seventy gold pieces," he announced, loud enough for the entire hall to hear. The whispers intensified. "The Howling Scars have been bleeding our caravans for months. You've done the guild a considerable service."

As the gold clinked into Steve's pouch, Cromwell leaned in. "A man of your... particular talents could go far with the right contracts. Exclusive deals. Premium rates. The guild takes care of its special assets."

Steve hefted the gold, feeling its weight. More money than Coffee Shop Steve had ever seen at once. But Berserker Steve just saw chains dressed in gold paint.

**Player**: "We're here, might as well get it over with. Signing up for some big commitment isn't my thing."

Steve turned and walked away, leaving Cromwell intrigued rather than insulted. The guild master's smile widened. The ones who walked away always came back. They just needed the right motivation.

## Scene 10: The Speedrun Berserker and His Young Fan

Marcus's Clothier was supposed to be a quick stop. Get pants that didn't show ass-crack during combat spins. Get a shirt that wasn't mostly holes and blood. Simple.

The bell above the door hadn't finished chiming when a young voice exploded with excitement.

"IT'S HIM! IT'S REALLY HIM!"

A thirteen-year-old boy practically vibrated with excitement, bouncing on his heels. Scrawny, with the kind of desperate hero worship that only young teens could manage. His guard trainee uniform was too big, hand-me-down from someone else.

"You're Steve! The Speedrun Berserker! I saw it - Kaya's been showing memory crystals all over the city! You killed the Threshold Beast in under a minute! Nobody's EVER done that!"

Marcus, the shopkeeper, sighed. "Tom, let the man shop in peace."

But Tom was already circling Steve like an excited puppy. "Is it true you went from coffee to Level 4 in one hour? Is it true you killed a Level 7 brute? Can I... can I see your axe?"

Steve looked at the kid. Saw himself at that age, before life beat the enthusiasm out of him. Before coffee shops and mortgages and mundane reality. Tom's father, he learned, had been a guard. Died of sickness, not battle. The kid wanted to be a berserker now, wanted to be like Steve.

"Here," Steve said, carefully handing over the Greataxe of First Blood. "Careful, it'sâ€”"

Tom's arms immediately dropped. The axe head hit the floor with a THUNK. The kid's face went red as he struggled to lift it, managed to get it maybe six inches up before his arms started shaking.

"How... how do you swing this like it's nothing?"

"Physics," Steve said, taking it back one-handed. "And a little bit of rage."

Marcus fitted Steve with a proper berserker's outfit - reinforced pants that could handle combat acrobatics, a padded vest for some protection, and a dark leather coat that looked badass while being practical. Seventy gold, but worth it to not flash the entire city during fights.

Tom chattered the entire time, explaining how Kaya had been showing the memory crystal recordings everywhere, how people were calling Steve the "Speedrun Berserker," how the other guards were taking bets on how fast he'd reach Level 10.

"Do you know somewhere quiet to eat?" Steve asked. "Somewhere people won't stare?"

Tom's face lit up. "The Drunken Griffin! My mom's friend Sara runs it. She doesn't care about levels or nothing. Plus she makes the best shepherd's pie in the lower district. I can show you the back alleys - nobody uses them but locals!"

**Player**: "Here ya go. Let's not hang around here too long though! Know a good place to grab some food?"

## Scene 11: Strategic Withdrawal

The Drunken Griffin lived up to its name. Dim, slightly seedy, with a stuffed griffin head on the wall that had seen better decades. Sara, the proprietor, was a sturdy woman who looked like she'd seen everything twice and wasn't impressed either time.

"Tom's friend, eh?" She looked Steve up and down. "The one causing all the fuss. Sit in the corner booth, away from the windows. I'll bring food."

Over ales and shepherd's pie that was indeed excellent, Garrett and Steve plotted.

"The Scarred Wolves will hear about the Howling Scars by nightfall," Garrett said, keeping his voice low. "Viktor's not stupid. He'll either come for revenge or go to ground."

"Neither works for me," Steve said. "I need levels. Experience. Can't take forty bandits at Level 4."

Garrett pulled out the map they'd taken from the bandit camp. "Three crisis zones on the Ashwood Trail. Sunken Mills - something's dragging travelers into the flooded ruins. Crow's Rest - giant ravens terrorizing grain shipments. Iron Mines - miners say something woke up in the deep tunnels."

"Three days of fighting," Steve calculated. "Level 4 to maybe 6 or 7?"

"If we survive. These aren't bandits. These are monsters. Real ones."

Steve grinned. Coffee Shop Steve would be terrified. Berserker Steve was already calculating momentum vectors for fighting in flooded ruins.

"We leave within the hour," Steve decided. "Before anyone can track us or make offers I'll refuse."

**Player**: "Nothing like a little intimidation and ghosting out to keep the Wolves uncertain about what's coming for them."

## Scene 12: A Promise to Return

The hardest part was Tom.

The kid had followed them back to the Griffin, chattering about training, about becoming Steve's squire, about learning to be a berserker. His enthusiasm was painful to watch because Steve remembered being that young, that hopeful.

"I can't take you with me," Steve said gently. "Where I'm going... it's not safe for Level 1s."

Tom's face fell like someone had punched him. "But... but I could help! I could carry things! I know the area!"

"Your mom needs you here," Steve said. "And I need you to do something for me."

He scribbled a quick note on a piece of parchment, handed it to Sara. 

**The Note**: "Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of. ~ Steve"

"Give this to him after we leave," Steve told Sara quietly. "And maybe... spread some rumors we headed south to Goldport?"

Sara nodded, understanding. "The boy lost his father last winter. You're the first thing that's made him smile in months."

"I'll come back," Steve said, meaning it. "When it's safer."

**Player**: "I didn't think of that. Gotta go, Tom, sorry, isn't safe - and more bad guys need taken care of."

## Scene 13: Beyond the Tutorial

The back door of the Drunken Griffin opened onto an alley that smelled of old beer and questionable decisions. Garrett was already there with supplies loaded onto a small handcart - potions, rations, whetstones, everything for three days of monster hunting.

"Ready?" Garrett asked.

"Almost." Steve turned to Sara. "Thanks for the food. And for understanding about Tom."

Sara shrugged. "The boy needs heroes. Even if they're bloody madmen who speedrun through life." She paused. "Oh, your friend Kaya was here this morning."

Steve froze. "Kaya was here?"

"Golden eyes, Spanish curse words? Yeah. Left a message." Sara's expression was unreadable. "Said 'the real game begins when you leave the tutorial city.'"

A chill ran down Steve's spine. Tutorial city. Like Ironhold was just the starting zone.

"Also said you'd understand soon enough what that means." Sara shrugged. "Weird girl. Paid in advance for your meal though."

Steve felt that familiar thrum of energy, that sense of standing on the edge of something vast. Coffee Shop Steve would have wanted more information, more preparation, more safety.

Berserker Steve just grinned.

"Thanks again. Mind if I use your back door again?"

Sara waved them off. "Go. Before Tom comes back and tries to follow you."

**Player**: "Thanks again, mind if I use your back door again?"

Steve and Garrett slipped into the afternoon shadows of Ironhold's back alleys. Behind them, the city buzzed with rumors of the Speedrun Berserker. Ahead, the Ashwood Trail waited with its monsters and mysteries.

Kaya was right. The tutorial was over.

The real game was about to begin.

## Session Summary

Steve entered Ironhold at Level 4, collected 370 gold in bounties, acquired proper equipment, and gained a reputation as the "Speedrun Berserker." Young Tom became his first real fan. With Garrett, he planned to tackle three crisis zones on the Ashwood Trail to gain levels before confronting the Scarred Wolves. They vanished from the city before anyone could pin them down, leaving only rumors and a promise to return.

The session established key relationships:
- Cromwell: Intrigued guild master who wants Steve under contract
- Tom: Hero-worshipping youth who lost his father
- Sara: Practical tavern keeper providing cover
- Kaya: Still mysterious, pushing Steve toward greater challenges

Current status: Level 4, leaving Ironhold with Garrett, 371 gold, fully equipped, heading east on the Ashwood Trail.
