# Session 004: The Burrower Battle
## Ashwood Trail - Journey to Sunken Mills

The wagon creaks along the Ashwood Trail, Henrik's knuckles white on the reins. Ten minutes out from Ironhold's gates, the forest already feels different - darker, older. The trees lean in like they're listening.

Garrett shifts in the wagon bed, hidden among turnip sacks. "Henrik's making good time. We might reach Sunken Mills before full dark if—"

The horses suddenly rear up, whinnying in terror. Henrik yanks the reins hard. "¡Coño! What in the seven—"

The road ahead... ripples. Like water, but it's solid earth. Something massive moves beneath, creating waves in the packed dirt. 

**[Perception Check: rolled 13 +4 = 17 vs DC 15 - SUCCESS!]**

"BURROWER!" Henrik screams, already scrambling to unhitch the horses. "Sweet mother of— It's a gods-damned BURROWER!"

The earth explodes twenty feet ahead. What emerges looks like someone crossed a centipede with a nightmare - thirty feet of armored segments, each the size of a wagon wheel. Its head is all mandibles and too many eyes.

**[Cave Burrower - Level 5]**
**[HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 95/95]**

Your berserker instincts catch something critical - the creature's underbelly segments flash a different color every few seconds. Soft pink between the armor plates. Vulnerable.

Garrett grins at Steve's enthusiasm about killing stuff. "Not often, no. Cave Burrowers usually stay deep underground. This one's either desperate or—" He pauses. "—driven up by something worse below."

"WORSE?!" Henrik is already twenty feet away with the horses. "I don't get paid enough for WORSE!"

The Burrower rears up, towering fifteen feet high. Its mandibles spread wide enough to swallow a man whole. Then it SCREAMS - a sound like grinding stone that makes your bones ache.

**[RAGE: ▓░░░░░░░░░ 10%]** *(Combat initiated!)*
**[Initiative: Steve rolls rolled 10 +4 = 14]**

Steve's already moving, that coffee-shop-Steve analysis instantly converting to berserker action. The wagon - it's the perfect launch platform. He vaults over Henrik's abandoned seat, using the wagon's height for momentum.

"Classic Steve!" Garrett shouts, flanking left. 

The Burrower strikes first, faster than something that size should move. Its head whips toward Steve like a battering ram!

**[Burrower Attack: rolled 19 +5 = 24 vs Your AC 17 - HIT!]**
**[Damage Taken: rolled 2,6 +3 = 11 damage]**
**[Steve HP: 156/180]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓░░░░░░░░ 20%]** *(+10% from taking hit)*

The mandibles catch Steve mid-leap, clamping around his torso! The new armor takes the worst of it, but those chitinous blades still pierce through. Blood flows.

But pain just makes him laugh. "THAT'S what I'm talking about!"

He's still airborne, caught in its jaws but not swallowed. Perfect position to strike at those soft segments!

"Seven hells, he's enjoying this," Garrett mutters, moving to strike at the creature's side.

Steve swings at what looks like a bunch of the mandible bite tendons and muscle - a pressure point made of exposed meat. 

**[Attack Roll: rolled 12 +6 = 18 vs Burrower AC 14 - HIT!]**
**[Damage Dealt: rolled 1,4 +6 = 11 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 84/95]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░ 30%]** *(+10% from dealing damage)*

The greataxe comes down in a vicious arc, and the blade bites deep into the soft tissue. The Burrower SHRIEKS and reflexively opens its mandibles, dropping Steve. He hits the ground in a roll, coming up ready. Purple ichor drips from the axe blade.

"Nice hit!" Garrett capitalizes on the distraction, his blade finding a soft spot between segments along its flank - though he can't reach as deep as he'd like.

**[Garrett's Damage: 7 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 77/95]**

The creature writhes, its segments rippling. Then it does something unexpected - it dives. The massive body disappears into the earth like it's water, leaving only a churning hole.

"It's going under!" Garrett shouts. "Watch for tremors!"

The ground beneath their feet starts to vibrate. It's circling below, choosing its angle. Henrik's cursing in three languages from his safe distance.

**[Berserker's Recovery: +2 HP]**
**[Steve HP: 158/180]**

Steve decides to time a leap to avoid the underground attack.

**[DEX Check - Timing the Jump: rolled 1 +4 = 5 vs DC 16 - FAILED!]**

Steve crouches, muscles coiled, waiting for that perfect moment... but his coffee-shop brain miscalculates the vibration pattern. He leaps a half-second too early!

The earth EXPLODES beneath where he was standing, but he's already airborne - just not high enough. The Burrower's massive head clips his legs as it erupts upward, sending him spinning!

**[Glancing Blow Damage: rolled 6 +2 = 8 damage]**
**[Steve HP: 150/180]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░ 40%]** *(+10% from taking damage)*

Steve crashes into the wagon's side, wood splintering. But here's the thing about berserkers - awkward landings just make better launch points. The wagon tilts from impact, creating a perfect ramp.

"That looked intentional!" Garrett shouts, not sure if he's joking. He strikes again at the creature's exposed segments while it's above ground.

**[Garrett's Attack: Finding soft spot between segments - 6 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 71/95]**

The Burrower is fully surfaced now, its entire thirty-foot length writhing above ground. Those pink vulnerable segments flash in sequence along its belly - if Steve could hit multiple segments in one strike...

The tilted wagon. The momentum. The physics are all there.

"Whatever you're thinking," Garrett calls out, "it's probably insane and I'm here for it!"

**[Berserker's Recovery: +2 HP]**
**[Steve HP: 152/180]**

Steve charges up the tilted wagon for a massive momentum swing!

**[Attack Roll - Massive Momentum Swing: rolled 7 +6 = 13 vs AC 14 - MISS!]**

He charges up the tilted wagon like it's an Olympic ski jump, greataxe raised high, building incredible rotational force... but the Burrower's segments RIPPLE at the last second, pulling those vulnerable spots just out of reach! The axe whistles through air, the momentum sending Steve into an uncontrolled spin past the creature.

**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░ 50%]** *(Frustration building!)*

"So close!" Garrett doesn't waste the distraction though, driving his blade deep between segments while it's focused on Steve.

**[Garrett's Critical Strike: 14 damage!]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ 57/95]**

The creature SCREAMS, whipping around with shocking speed. Its tail - thick as a tree trunk - sweeps toward both of them!

**[Tail Sweep - Steve: HIT! | Garrett: MISS!]**
**[Tail Slam Damage: rolled 5,2 +2 = 9 damage]**
**[Steve HP: 143/180]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ 60%]** *(+10% from damage)*

The tail catches Steve square in the ribs, launching him into a tree. Bark explodes on impact. Garrett rolls under it, coming up in perfect form.

"You alright?" he calls.

Steve spits blood and grins. The rage is building now - that familiar heat spreading through his muscles. "Never better!"

The Burrower coils, preparing to dive again. But Steve notices something - purple ichor is pooling where Garrett struck deep. It's slowing down. Wounded prey.

**[Berserker's Recovery: +2 HP]**
**[Steve HP: 145/180]**

Henrik yells from his safe distance: "The soft bits glow brighter when it's about to dive! Look!"

He's right - those pink segments are practically glowing now.

"I feel like I need to go back to squishy bandits!" Steve shouts, then charges to pry up armor plates.

**[Attack Roll: rolled 18 +6 = 24 vs AC 14 - HIT!]**

"Bandits ARE squishier!" Steve roars, charging straight at the glowing segments. His axe blade wedges perfectly under an armor plate, and he WRENCHES with all that berserker strength!

**[Damage: rolled 1,3 +6 + 4 (plate torn) = 14 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░ 43/95]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 70%]** *(+10% from dealing damage)*

The armor plate RIPS away with a wet tearing sound, exposing raw pink flesh beneath. Purple blood sprays across Steve's face. The creature's shriek shifts pitch - from anger to genuine pain.

"There we go!" Garrett capitalizes, driving his sword into the exposed wound!

**[Garrett's Precision Strike: 11 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░ 32/95]**

The Burrower thrashes wildly, no longer trying to dive - it's panicking! Its whole body convulses, and suddenly it's vomiting something. Acid? No... eggs? Dozens of softball-sized, pulsing eggs splatter across the road.

"Oh, seven hells," Garrett backs up. "It's a breeding female. Those eggs—"

CRACK. One egg splits open. A foot-long baby burrower emerges, all teeth and hunger.

CRACK. CRACK. CRACK.

"THIS is why I wanted bandits!" Steve laughs, even as a dozen mini-burrowers start skittering toward them.

**[Berserker's Recovery: +2 HP]**
**[Steve HP: 147/180]**

"Hold off the babies, I can finish her!" Steve shouts.

**[Attack Roll - Finishing Strike: rolled 15 +6 = 21 vs AC 14 - HIT!]**

"On it!" Garrett spins, blade flashing as he intercepts the skittering hatchlings. "Make it quick!"

Steve charges the mother, who's still reeling from blood loss. The greataxe finds that exposed wound where he tore the plate away—

**[Damage: rolled 2,5 +6 + 4 (exposed flesh) = 17 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: ▓▓░░░░░░░░ 15/95]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 80%]**

The axe bites DEEP into exposed organs. The mother Burrower convulses, spraying more purple ichor. Behind them, Garrett's systematically destroying hatchlings—the sound of his blade singing through air, followed by wet squelches.

"Seven more down!" he reports. "But they keep coming!"

The mother, desperate and dying, makes one last attempt. She coils tight, then LUNGES with her remaining strength, mandibles spread wide to swallow Steve whole!

**[Desperate Bite: rolled 3 +3 = 6 vs AC 17 - MISS!]**

Too slow! Blood loss has made her sluggish. Steve sidesteps easily, and now she's overextended, that torn-open wound completely exposed.

"Steve! Finish it! I've got about twenty angry babies here!" Garrett's starting to sound stressed.

**[Berserker's Recovery: +2 HP]**
**[Steve HP: 149/180]**

Steve prepares for a massive, full-body executioner's swing!

**[Final Strike: rolled 14 +6 = 20 vs AC 14 - HIT!]**

Steve plants his feet, raises the greataxe high overhead—coffee shop Steve would call this "maximum kinetic energy transfer"—and brings it down with EVERYTHING he's got!

**[EXECUTIONER'S STRIKE: rolled 6,2 +6 + rolled 2,4 (coup de grace) = 20 damage]**
**[Cave Burrower HP: 0/95 - DEAD!]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%]**

The axe goes THROUGH her. Through the exposed organs, through the other side, and embeds six inches into the road beneath. The mother Burrower's segments spasm once, twice... then go still.

The effect on the babies is immediate. They freeze, chirping in confusion, their primitive minds unable to process the loss of the hive-mother.

"NOW we're talking!" Garrett takes advantage, his blade a silver blur as he cuts down the stunned hatchlings. "That's the last of them!"

**[XP GAINED: 115 XP]**
**[Total XP: 430/800 to Level 5]**

Henrik cautiously approaches with the horses. "¡Madre de Dios! You actually killed it! A Level 5 Cave Burrower!" He stares at the massive corpse. "Those things eat whole caravans!"

Garrett's wiping purple blood off his sword, grinning. "Not bad for a roadside encounter. Though you asked for bandits, not nightmare worms."

## Harvesting and Recovery

Steve helps pry off plates. "Well, gold _is_ useful, and the sooner we finish cleanup here..."

**[Harvested: 13 armor plates, 8 intact egg shells]**
**[RAGE: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░ 30%]** *(Fading as combat ends)*

Steve and Garrett work efficiently, prying off the best-preserved plates. The armor comes away with wet sucking sounds, each piece the size of a dinner plate and surprisingly light.

"These'll fetch maybe 15 gold each in Ironhold," Garrett estimates, wrapping them in canvas from the wagon. "But in Crow's Rest? The merchant guilds there pay triple for exotic materials."

Henrik's already calculating. "That's... sweet mother, that's almost 600 gold if we wait!"

"IF we make it to Crow's Rest," Garrett adds, securing the egg shells more carefully. "These are fragile but valuable. Alchemists use them for speed potions."

Steve notices something else—where the mother died, there's a strange shimmer in the air. Like heat distortion, but cold.

**[WIS Check: rolled 5 = 5 vs DC 14 - FAILED!]**

The shimmer makes his head hurt to look at. Whatever it is, it's beyond his understanding. Garrett notices the stare.

"Dimensional tear," he says quietly. "When something that big dies violently, sometimes reality... cracks a little. It'll seal itself in a few hours." He pauses. "Unless something comes through first."

Henrik crosses himself. "We should go. NOW."

The wagon's quickly loaded with their spoils:
- **13 Burrower Plates** (15-45g each depending on buyer)
- **8 Egg Shells** (5-10g each to alchemists)

## Journey to Sunken Mills

Steve leans back against the wagon's side, letting his berserker constitution do its work. The cuts close, bruises fade. His body knows how to heal—it's had practice.

**[Natural Recovery: 7 HP restored]**
**[Steve HP: 156/180]**
**[RAGE: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%]** *(Fully faded)*

Garrett catches Steve's one-eyed look and laughs too, shaking his head. "You know what? You're absolutely insane. That thing could've swallowed you whole and you were ENJOYING it."

"Better than spreadsheets," Steve mutters, which makes no sense to Garrett but makes perfect sense to Coffee Shop Steve.

Henrik calls back nervously, "You two are laughing? We just fought a nightmare and you're LAUGHING?"

"It's a berserker thing," Garrett explains. "They process trauma differently. Mostly by wanting more of it."

The wagon rolls on. The forest gets darker, thicker. That smell of rot gets stronger. Through the trees, they catch glimpses of water where there shouldn't be water—flooding that reaches up tree trunks, turning solid ground into swamp.

An hour passes peacefully. 

**[HP Recovery continues: 163/180]**

Then Henrik pulls the horses to a stop. "This... this is as far as I go." 

Ahead, the road disappears into black water. What was once a bridge is now just broken posts sticking up like rotten teeth. On the far side, maybe three hundred yards through flooded forest, you can see buildings. Or what's left of them. Half-submerged structures, roofs poking through stagnant water like islands.

"Sunken Mills," Garrett says quietly. "Two weeks ago it was a thriving lumber town. Then the underground river changed course. Flash flood in the middle of the night. Most didn't make it out."

Something moves in the water. Just a ripple, but wrong somehow.

"The ones who didn't make it," Henrik whispers, "they say they're still down there. Still trying to get out."

Garrett's already grabbing his pack. "We'll need to wade or find boats. Steve, you ready for this?"

The sun's touching the tree line. Maybe an hour of light left. Sunken Mills awaits, Level 3-5 threats promised, and whatever's moving in that water.

*Session 004 ends at the threshold of Sunken Mills, Steve at 163/180 HP, both adventurers facing their first crisis zone as darkness approaches.*
