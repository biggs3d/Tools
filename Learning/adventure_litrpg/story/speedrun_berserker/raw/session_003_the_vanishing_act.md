# Session 03: The Vanishing Act - Phoenix Tears and Ghost Departure

## Scene 1: Hedda's Rare Goods - The Merchant's Son

After leaving the Drunken Griffin, Steve found himself in the cramped confines of Hedda Grimstone's shop. The cluster of tiny bells chimed in discordant harmony as he entered. The interior was exactly what you'd expect—cramped, dusty, and packed floor to ceiling with things that might be junk or might save your life.

"Another 'hero' come to waste my time?" came a raspy voice from behind a tower of scrolls. 

An elderly woman emerged, her eyes sharp as broken glass despite her hunched frame. She stopped mid-complaint, squinting at Steve. 

"Wait... you're that berserker. The one who dropped the Howling Scars in twenty minutes."

She shuffled closer, barely reaching Steve's chest. "Hedda Grimstone. I deal in items that actually *do* something, not the pretty garbage they sell on Main Street. You've got the look of someone who values function over flash."

Her shop was a treasure trove of practical magic. The Blooddrinker's Cord that converted damage to healing. Ironwall Bracers for those who liked not dying. But what caught Steve's attention was a small vial that seemed to pulse with inner light.

"Phoenix Tears," Hedda explained. "Auto-revive at twenty-five percent health. Once. Better than any potion because you don't have to be conscious to use it."

"How much?"

"Four hundred gold. Non-negotiable."

Steve considered. Then pulled out something else—the blood-crusted eye patch from the Razorback Leader, and the Leader's Insignia.

"By the way," Steve said casually, "with the town in peak excitement as it is, what do you think the Howling Scars's Leader's eye patch would go for right now?"

Hedda's eyes lit with genuine amusement. Not greed—amusement. Like she'd just been handed the setup to a perfect joke. She pulled out a communication crystal, whispered into it for a moment.

"Give it five minutes," she said.

Three minutes later, the door burst open. Lord Pemberton's son—all silk and velvet and barely contained excitement—practically vibrated in place. His hands shook as Steve produced the trophies.

"Three hundred fifty gold," Hedda stated firmly. 

The lordling didn't even haggle. Gold spilled from his purse without counting. He clutched the eye patch and insignia like holy relics.

"Could you... could you tell me how you killed them?" His voice cracked with hero worship.

Steve leaned in slightly. The boy actually stepped back.

"Fast."

That's all Steve said. The lordling nodded rapidly and scrambled out, probably to show his friends his new trophies.

Hedda cackled. Actually cackled. "Oh, I like you. You've got style. Tell you what—the Phoenix Tears for four hundred, but I'll throw in this." She produced a detailed map. "Scarred Wolves territory. Every camp, every patrol route. Came from a defector who didn't live long enough to use it."

"And these." Three small pellets. "Smoke bombs. For when you need to disappear. Which, given your rapid fame, might be sooner than later."

Steve counted out the gold. Four hundred seventy-five total, but the Phoenix Tears alone could be the difference between legend and corpse.

**Player**: "Sold the trophies for 350 gold, will take Phoenix Tears, map, and smoke pellets."

## Scene 2: The Strategic Exit

Steve slipped back into the maze of alleys, taking the long way around toward the East Gate. The shadows were deeper here, perfect cover as he moved parallel to the main road. Through gaps between buildings, he caught glimpses of Henrik's wagon—loaded with vegetables, nothing suspicious about a farmer heading home before dark.

Garrett was there, playing up a limp, helping load the wagon while complaining loudly about his bad knee. Ex-military indeed—the man could have been an actor.

Moving closer through the narrow passages, Steve found a good vantage point behind some empty crates. From here he could see everything—the bored gate guards more interested in discussing tonight's tavern plans than checking wagons, other merchants preparing evening departures, and Garrett now "accidentally" dropping a sack of potatoes.

"¡Maldita sea! My back!" Garrett cursed, limping after the spilled vegetables. The limp conveniently brought him near Steve's position. His voice dropped to a mutter. "Nice shopping trip? We're third in line. When Henrik's wagon clears, count to thirty then follow."

The wagon rolled forward. The guards barely glanced at Henrik's papers—vegetables weren't exactly contraband. They waved him through with bored efficiency.

Steve counted to thirty, then stepped out of the alley, walking casually toward the gate like any other traveler. No hurry. No suspicion. Just a Level 4 adventurer leaving before dark.

"Gate closes at full dark," one guard said without looking up from his dice game.

"Won't need that long," Steve replied, walking through.

The Ashwood Trail stretched ahead, dust motes dancing in the last rays of sunlight. Steve kept a steady pace, not too fast, not too slow. Just another traveler on the road.

Ten minutes out, once the city walls were just a shape in the distance, Garrett's head popped up from between the turnip sacks in Henrik's wagon.

"Clear!" He grinned, vegetables still stuck in his hair. "We actually pulled it off. Ghost departure, no fanfare, no complications."

He climbed forward to sit properly, brushing turnips off his armor. "Though I'll smell like vegetables for a week."

Henrik, who'd been rigid with tension, finally relaxed. "You two are insane. But your gold spends well enough." He'd been paid triple rate for the risk.

"Sunken Mills is four hours at wagon pace," Garrett said, checking the map. "We'll arrive after dark, which might be perfect. Whatever's dragging people into those ruins probably hunts at night."

Steve felt the Phoenix Tears vial warm against his chest where he'd tucked it. The Scarred Wolves map was secure in his pack. Three smoke bombs ready if needed.

Behind them, Ironhold buzzed with rumors of the Speedrun Berserker. People would search the taverns, the inns, the guild halls. By the time they realized he was gone, he'd be three crisis zones away and two levels stronger.

"Ready to turn this milk run into a legend?" Garrett asked.

**Player**: "Definitely! Time to hit the road."

## Scene 3: The Ashwood Trail Begins

The wagon creaked along the dirt road as darkness crept in from the forest edges. Henrik had lit a small lantern, but it only made the shadows deeper. The cheerful farmland near Ironhold had given way to older, wilder country. The trees here were ancient, their branches forming a canopy that blocked out stars.

"Used to patrol this road," Garrett said quietly. "Back when I was Captain. Lost three men to whatever's in Sunken Mills. Command said it was bandits. But bandits don't drag full-grown men into water and leave nothing but boots."

Steve checked his equipment one more time. Greataxe sharp and ready. Armor fitted properly thanks to Marcus's work. Phoenix Tears secure. The weight of real danger settled on his shoulders—not bandits this time, but actual monsters.

"Tell me about Sunken Mills," Steve said.

"Flooding destroyed it five years ago," Garrett explained. "Dam burst upstream. Killed half the village instantly. The survivors abandoned it within a week. Said the dead didn't stay dead. Now it's half-underwater ruins, and things live in those waters. Things that hunt."

Henrik shuddered. "Why we taking this road then?"

"Because," Steve said, "the main road goes right past the Scarred Wolves' checkpoint. This way, we're ghosts. Plus, I need the experience."

Coffee Shop Steve would have taken the safe road, the known path. But Berserker Steve understood something fundamental: in a world with levels, safety was an illusion. The only real safety was being too strong for anything to threaten you.

And that meant hunting monsters in flooded ruins at night.

The wagon rolled on, wheels crunching on old dirt. In the distance, through the trees, Steve could smell it—stagnant water, rot, and something else. Something that made his rage stir without prompting.

"Two hours to Sunken Mills," Henrik said nervously. "Where exactly do you want me to stop?"

"Close enough to walk, far enough to run," Garrett said. "We'll clear a safe zone, then you can move closer."

Steve gripped his axe handle. The tutorial was over. The real game—the dangerous game—was about to begin.

Somewhere in the darkness, something splashed.
