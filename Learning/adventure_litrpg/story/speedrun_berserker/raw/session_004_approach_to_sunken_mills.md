# Session 004: Approach to Sunken Mills

## Scene 1: Leaving Ironhold Behind

*The cart rattles along the packed dirt road, Ironhold's walls shrinking behind you. Henrik keeps the horses at a steady pace, knuckles white on the reins. The afternoon sun beats down, making your still-damp clothes steam slightly.*

*Garrett shifts his frame on the wooden bench, armor clanking. He's been watching you since you left the gates - not suspicious, more... evaluating.*

"So," *he finally says, pulling out a leather flask.* "The Immediate. That's what they're calling you." *He takes a swig, offers it to you.* "Strong whiskey. Good for the nerves, though something tells me yours are made of steel cable."

*The flask is quality leather, monogrammed with 'G.I.' in silver. Everything about Garrett speaks of professional success - the kind earned in blood.*

"Twelve years I've been doing this," *he continues, eyes on the countryside rolling past.* "Started as a guard like Tom back there. Worked my way up. Thought I'd seen everything." *He glances at you.* "Then you show up and solo three Level 7s before your morning coffee gets cold."

*Henrik snorts from the driver's seat.* "Begging your pardon, but could we not talk about the murderous bandits while we're on the same road they use?"

*Garrett chuckles.* "Henrik's got a point. Though I doubt we'll see trouble. Not with The Scarred Wolves pulled back to lick their wounds." *He pauses.* "That storm trick. Where'd you learn something like that?"

*Before you can answer, he waves it off.* "Actually, don't tell me. Every berserker needs their secrets. Just..." *his expression goes serious,* "when we hit the Mills, follow my lead initially. I know you could probably speedrun the whole thing, but these crisis zones... they're different. Wrong. The flooding there isn't natural."

*The cart hits a pothole. Henrik curses. Garrett steadies himself and looks ahead where the road disappears into a line of trees.*

"Two hours to the Mills. Get some rest if you can. Won't be much chance for it once we arrive."

## Scene 2: The Nap and the Approach

*You lean back against the cart's side, battle-lust fading into that familiar post-combat exhaustion. The rhythmic clatter of wheels on stone is hypnotic. Coffee Shop Steve would never sleep on a cart heading into danger. But Berserker Steve knows when to rest.*

*The last thing you see before closing your eyes is Garrett pulling out a whetstone, beginning the meditation of blade maintenance...*

**[TIME SKIP: 2 Hours Later...]**

*You wake to silence.*

*No, not silence - the absence of the right sounds. The wheels still turn, but slower. The horses' breathing is shallow, nervous. Even the birds have stopped.*

*The air is wrong. Thick. Humid like a summer storm, but the sky is clear. It smells like a basement that flooded years ago and never quite dried.*

*Garrett's hand is on his sword. Not drawn, but ready. His eyes scan the tree line.*

"Welcome to the Mills' influence," *he says quietly.* "We're still half a mile out, but the wrongness... it spreads."

*Henrik pulls the horses to a stop at a bend in the road. Through the trees, you can see it - or what's left of it. Sunken Mills, living up to its new name.*

*The entire valley is flooded. Water black as oil in the dying light, perfectly still like glass. Buildings rise from it like broken teeth - a church steeple here, a mill's waterwheel there, still turning despite no current. Impossible. Wrong.*

*And the silence. No insects. No frogs. Nothing that should live in water. Just the endless, slow creak of that wheel turning.*

"This is as far as I go," *Henrik says, voice cracking slightly.* "You want me to wait?"

*Garrett hops down, boots squelching in the muddy road.* "Give us until dawn. If we're not back by then..." *He tosses Henrik a heavy purse.* "That's hazard pay. Get back to Ironhold. Tell them the Mills are lost."

*Henrik nods rapidly, already turning the cart around.*

*Garrett looks at you, then at the drowned village below. Orange sunset light makes the black water look like old blood.*

"There's a maintenance path along the old aqueduct. Should keep us above water level, at least initially." *He pauses.* "Steve... whatever's down there, it's been feeding on the drowned for weeks. Growing. The guild sent a team ten days ago." 

*He points to the water. Something pale floats near what used to be the market square. Could be driftwood. Could be bone.*

"Never reported back."

*The waterwheel creaks. Turns. Creaks. Turns.*

*Your berserker instincts are stirring. This isn't just a crisis zone. It's something hungry. Something that takes normal death and makes it... worse.*
