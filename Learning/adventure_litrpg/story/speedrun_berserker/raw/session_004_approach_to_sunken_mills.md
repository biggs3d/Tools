# Session 004: Approach to Sunken Mills

## Scene 1: Leaving Ironhold Behind

*The cart rattles along the packed dirt road, Ironhold's walls shrinking behind you. Henrik keeps the horses at a steady pace, knuckles white on the reins. The afternoon sun beats down, making your still-damp clothes steam slightly.*

*Garrett shifts his frame on the wooden bench, armor clanking. He's been watching you since you left the gates - not suspicious, more... evaluating.*

"So," *he finally says, pulling out a leather flask.* "The Immediate. That's what they're calling you." *He takes a swig, offers it to you.* "Strong whiskey. Good for the nerves, though something tells me yours are made of steel cable."

*The flask is quality leather, monogrammed with 'G.I.' in silver. Everything about Garrett speaks of professional success - the kind earned in blood.*

"Twelve years I've been doing this," *he continues, eyes on the countryside rolling past.* "Started as a guard like Tom back there. Worked my way up. Thought I'd seen everything." *He glances at you.* "Then you show up and solo three Level 7s before your morning coffee gets cold."

*Henrik snorts from the driver's seat.* "Begging your pardon, but could we not talk about the murderous bandits while we're on the same road they use?"

*Garrett chuckles.* "Henrik's got a point. Though I doubt we'll see trouble. Not with The Scarred Wolves pulled back to lick their wounds." *He pauses.* "That storm trick. Where'd you learn something like that?"

*Before you can answer, he waves it off.* "Actually, don't tell me. Every berserker needs their secrets. Just..." *his expression goes serious,* "when we hit the Mills, follow my lead initially. I know you could probably speedrun the whole thing, but these crisis zones... they're different. Wrong. The flooding there isn't natural."

*The cart hits a pothole. Henrik curses. Garrett steadies himself and looks ahead where the road disappears into a line of trees.*

"Two hours to the Mills. Get some rest if you can. Won't be much chance for it once we arrive."

## Scene 2: The Nap and the Approach

*You lean back against the cart's side, battle-lust fading into that familiar post-combat exhaustion. The rhythmic clatter of wheels on stone is hypnotic. Coffee Shop Steve would never sleep on a cart heading into danger. But Berserker Steve knows when to rest.*

*The last thing you see before closing your eyes is Garrett pulling out a whetstone, beginning the meditation of blade maintenance...*

**[TIME SKIP: 2 Hours Later...]**

---

*You wake to silence.*

*No, not silence - the absence of the right sounds. The wheels still turn, but slower. The horses' breathing is shallow, nervous. Even the birds have stopped.*

*The air is wrong. Thick. Humid like a summer storm, but the sky is clear. It smells like a basement that flooded years ago and never quite dried.*

*Garrett's hand is on his sword. Not drawn, but ready. His eyes scan the tree line.*

"Welcome to the Mills' influence," *he says quietly.* "We're still half a mile out, but the wrongness... it spreads."

*Henrik pulls the horses to a stop at a bend in the road. Through the trees, you can see it - or what's left of it. Sunken Mills, living up to its new name.*

*The entire valley is flooded. Water black as oil in the dying light, perfectly still like glass. Buildings rise from it like broken teeth - a church steeple here, a mill's waterwheel there, still turning despite no current. Impossible. Wrong.*

*And the silence. No insects. No frogs. Nothing that should live in water. Just the endless, slow creak of that wheel turning.*

"This is as far as I go," *Henrik says, voice cracking slightly.* "You want me to wait?"

*Garrett hops down, boots squelching in the muddy road.* "Give us until dawn. If we're not back by then..." *He tosses Henrik a heavy purse.* "That's hazard pay. Get back to Ironhold. Tell them the Mills are lost."

*Henrik nods rapidly, already turning the cart around.*

*Garrett looks at you, then at the drowned village below. Orange sunset light makes the black water look like old blood.*

"There's a maintenance path along the old aqueduct. Should keep us above water level, at least initially." *He pauses.* "Steve... whatever's down there, it's been feeding on the drowned for weeks. Growing. The guild sent a team ten days ago." 

*He points to the water. Something pale floats near what used to be the market square. Could be driftwood. Could be bone.*

"Never reported back."

*The waterwheel creaks. Turns. Creaks. Turns.*

*Your berserker instincts are stirring. This isn't just a crisis zone. It's something hungry. Something that takes normal death and makes it... worse.*

**[ENTERING: Sunken Mills - Crisis Zone]**
**[Quest Updated: Investigate the Drowning Dark]**
**[Warning: Unknown Elite Entity Detected]**

---

## Scene 3: First Blood at Sunken Mills

*Halfway down the aqueduct path, encounter with drowned guild investigator. Body twisted wrong - webbed fingers, mouth too wide, vomiting black water. Steve critical hits with a baseball-swing launch, sending it flying 30 feet into the black water below. Garrett impressed by physics-based solution.*

*Now at the plaza overlook. Six drowned villagers standing in chest-deep water, heads tilted back, mouths open, waiting. Something large moving beneath them - using them as bait. Two paths visible: rope bridge to church steeple (high ground but sketchy), or maintenance ladder to mill second floor (closer to danger). Full darkness approaching in ~10 minutes.*

## Scene 4: Into the Mill

*Stealth attempt critically fails - loose stone alerts all drowned. The underwater entity revealed as "The Drowned Congregation" - Level 6 Elite horror made of fused bodies with tentacle-arms. Mad scramble up the ladder with drowned climbing after us. Steve demolishes entire window frame to get inside (STR 24!). Kicked climbing drowned off ladder.*

*Now on mill's second floor - grain storage with bones, rotted wheat, and puddles of black water that shouldn't exist above flood line. Garrett barricaded the entrance. Something sapient upstairs invited us up to see "the transformation." Boss encounter imminent.*

## Scene 5: Boss Battle - The Drowned Miller

*Garrett sees your expression and his eyes widen.* "Oh no. Steve, that's not—"

*Too late. You're already moving.*

*You leap onto the grain sacks, using them as a springboard. The footsteps above pause - right there, perfect. You channel every ounce of berserker strength, every bit of built-up rage, and DRIVE the greataxe up into the ceiling.*

**[RAGE RELEASE: 30% → Surprise Attack!]**
**[NATURAL 20! CRITICAL HIT THROUGH THE FLOOR!]**

*The axe punches through the rotted floorboards like they're paper. You feel it connect with something soft, wet. A SHRIEK erupts from above - not pain, but surprise and... delight?*

**[CRITICAL DAMAGE: 20 + RAGE BONUS: 6 = 26 TOTAL!]**

*Black water GUSHES through the hole you've created, pouring down like a waterfall. But mixed with it... something else. Thick, viscous, glowing faintly blue. Definitely not blood.*

*The voice above LAUGHS - a wet, delighted sound.*

"Oh, MARVELOUS! Such violence! Such creativity! You must be the one they call The Immediate!"

*The ceiling EXPLODES downward as something massive crashes through. What lands between you is... was... the miller.*

**[THE DROWNED MILLER - Level 7 Boss]**
**[HP: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 94/120]**

*But he's wrong. Seven feet tall now, muscles bloated with that black water, skin translucent so you can see it flowing through him like veins. His eyes glow that same faint blue, and when he smiles, water dribbles from between too many teeth.*

"I was going to invite you up for tea," *he gurgles.* "But this is so much better! Direct! Immediate!"

[Battle continues with full dialogue and action through to...]

**[RAGE RELEASE: 40% → DEVASTATING STRIKE!]**

"GOODNIGHT!"

*Your axe connects with his midsection with a wet THWACK that echoes through the mill. The blade doesn't just cut - it DETONATES his water-form.*

"No... I was... so... close..."

*He explodes in a torrent of black water, drenching the entire room.*

**[THE DROWNED MILLER - DEFEATED!]**

## Scene 6: Aftermath and Level Up

*"Seven hells, Steve! You turned him into a puddle!" Garrett looks at the spreading black water. "Literally!"*

*The mill groans around you. Without the Miller's will holding it together, it's starting to collapse.*

"We need to move!" *Garrett grabs the crystal and journal.* "This whole place is coming down!"

**[XP GAINED: 460!]**
**[Current XP: 890/2,400]**

"No time for stairs, out the hole!"

*You both sprint for the hole you smashed earlier. The mill is tilting hard now. You dive through first, Garrett right after.*

*You hit the water hard but controlled, knees bent. Garrett splashes down beside you.* "GO GO GO!"

*The mill collapses in on itself. A wave of displaced water rushes at you. You wash up against what used to be the baker's shop, gasping.*

*Garrett pulls himself up beside you.* "Steve... look."

*The water around the rubble is glowing faintly, then fading. Like something's being cleansed.*

**[CRISIS ZONE CLEARED: Sunken Mills]**

*A familiar voice cuts through the night:*

"*¡Qué bárbaro!* You didn't just clear it, *mijo*. You speedran it."

*Kaya steps out from behind a ruined wall, completely dry. Her golden eyes glow in the darkness.*

"One crisis zone down in... what, thirty minutes? The guild usually takes three days. At this rate, you'll hit Level 10 by breakfast."

"Well, I live to over-achieve, Kaya, you know me... things just happen! Question: do you know what we should do with this crystal? You know things."

*She holds out her hand for the crystal. When Garrett hesitates, she rolls her eyes.*

"*Por favor*, if I wanted to hurt your boy here, would I need a crystal? Give."

*The moment it touches Kaya's palm, it flares bright blue.*

"Ah. *Qué interesante.* This is a Transformation Core. Very rare. Very dangerous in the wrong hands. For him, more meant more consumed by water. For you? Who knows? More immediate? More berserker? Keep it, but don't use it. Not yet."

**[LEVEL UP! LEVEL 5 ACHIEVED!]**
**[HP INCREASED: 151/183]**

"Level 5 in four hours? *Dios mío*, at this rate you'll break the system before you even meet the real players."

*Garrett stares.* "Real players?"

"Oh, didn't I mention? Steve's not the only one who got pulled through during the Convergence. But he IS the fastest."

*She starts walking away.* "Oh, and Steve? That rage you're building? It's not just a combat mechanic. It's *you*. Coffee Shop Steve is fading, Berserker Steve is growing. Which one do you want to be when you hit Level 10?"

*She vanishes. Garrett breaks the silence:* "Your friends are terrifying."

"Most of the women I have the luck of meeting sure are!" *You laugh and clap Garrett on the shoulder.* "Let's get out of here, back to the wagon and Henrik before we have to answer questions. I wouldn't mind drying off too."

*You look down at your criss-crossed chest wound healing.* "Now _that_ vest and shirt didn't last long."

## Scene 7: Rest at the Waystation

*Garrett looks at your ruined shirt - slashed in an X pattern, more holes than fabric.*

"At this rate, you're going to single-handedly keep Marcus's clothing shop in business. Though I'm starting to think we should just invest in chainmail. Or accept that 'shirtless berserker' is your aesthetic."

*You both slog through the mud, leaving the draining valley behind. As you climb back toward the road, Garrett pulls out a flask.*

"Here. Stamina draught. You look like you went ten rounds with a water elemental." *He pauses.* "Which... I suppose you did."

*At the top of the ridge - Henrik's wagon, right where you left it. The old driver is standing on the bench, lantern raised.*

"Seven hells and a half! The water's draining! The whole bloody valley is— Is that BLOOD?"

*You look down. Between the water, the black ichor from the Miller, and your own blood, you look like you've been through a blender.*

"It's... mostly not mine?"

*Henrik's eyes go wide.* "Get in the wagon before someone sees you and thinks you're another drowned thing!"

*He tosses you a rough blanket.* "Dry off with that. And... is that Kaya I saw down there?"

"You know her?" *Garrett asks carefully.*

*Henrik crosses himself.* "Know her? Everyone knows OF her. Shows up before big events. Some say she's lucky. Others say she CAUSES the events. Either way... if she's interested in you, lad, your life's about to get real complicated."

*He snaps the reins, getting the horses moving.*

"So, where to? Back to Ironhold to report success, or... you mentioned other crisis zones?"

*Garrett's cleaning his sword.* "Crow's Rest is four hours north. Could make it by dawn if we push. Iron Mines are further - full day's travel into the mountains."

"We should probably at least get a few hours of sleep before then. If you show me, I can take a watch with the horses while you catch some shuteye in the back of the wagon, Henrik." *You turn to Garrett.* "I wouldn't mind stopping before the next adventure and letting things dry out around a fire before... well, the next time something ruins a shirt."

*Henrik nods gratefully.* "Aye, that'd be good. There's a waystation about an hour up the road - got a fire pit and a lean-to."

*An hour later, you reach the waystation. Henrik gratefully crawls into the wagon while you and Garrett get a fire going. You strip off your ruined shirt, laying it near the fire. The X-shaped scar on your chest is already fading.*

*Garrett watches the fire, thoughtful.*

"Steve... Kaya's right about one thing. You're changing fast. Not just the levels - the way you fight, the way you think. Coffee Shop Steve wouldn't have charged a boss monster with a grin on his face."

*He pulls out the Miller's journal, flipping through it by firelight.*

"But maybe that's what this world needs. Someone who doesn't overthink, just... acts. Immediately."

**[STATS ALLOCATED: STR 21, CON 18, DEX 18]**

*The fire pops and crackles. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf howls - normal wolf, not cursed.*

"Get some rest," *Garrett says.* "I'll take first watch. Tomorrow we hunt some angry birds."
