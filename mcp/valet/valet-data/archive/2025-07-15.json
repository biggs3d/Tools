Making good progress!\\n\\n Level 2 has a LOT more steps and movement compared to Level 1, but really enjoying it! All three sub-levels (A, B, C) are together in one class, so met tons of new people - great for expanding the social circle and potential dance partners.\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"keywords\": [\n      \"journal\",\n      \"personal\",\n      \"2025-07-15\"\n    ],\n    \"created\": \"2025-07-15T19:26:38.321Z\",\n    \"updated\": \"2025-07-15T19:59:19.494Z\"\n  }\n}"
