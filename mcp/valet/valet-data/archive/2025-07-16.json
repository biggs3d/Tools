Minimap project: pushed working files, remaining issues left for coworkers to handle. Not spending 2 days on what takes them 2 minutes this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nMinimap bug resolved!

Live CLAUDE.md editing - Show how project-specific instructions immediately change Claude's behavior\\n2. MCP server integration - Quick demo of valet or memory-link servers in action\\n3. Settings.json customization - Show permission controls and tool configurations\\n4. Prompt engineering strategies - Live example of confidence elicitation or metacognitive prompting\\n5. Demonstrate literature strategies while showing technical implementation\\n\\n5 Literature Strategies to showcase:\\n1. Metacognitive prompting\\n2. Meta chain of thought\\n3.
