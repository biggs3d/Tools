Open dancing afterward is awkward finding partners since several women leave right after instruction, but I've managed it a few times. Need to push through the tiredness more often.\n\n\n\nðŸŽ‰ Graduated to Bachata Level 2 last week! Now doing A, B, & C for three months before Level 3. Making good progress!\n\n Level 2 has a LOT more steps and movement compared to Level 1, but really enjoying it! All three sub-levels (A, B, C) are together in one class, so met tons of new people - great for expanding the social circle and potential dance partners."
